## Talking Points for Each Featured Contract

### Contract 1 - Construction IDIQ
"This is a BILLION dollar IDIQ from NAVFAC. What's interesting is it's a multiple award - 5 different primes hold this contract. That means when it recompetes, they're going to need subcontractors. If you're in construction, concrete, steel, electrical, mechanical - these primes are going to be looking for partners."

### Contract 2 - NIH IT
"Here's a great example of a small-business-sized IT contract. Under $10 million, with NIH. Axle Informatics is a small business themselves, so they understand the value of teaming. If you do health IT, data analytics, software development - this is exactly the kind of opportunity to pursue."

### Contract 3 - Graphic Design
"This one surprises people - almost $10 million for graphic design services with the Army. The government needs marketing, communications, video production. If you're a creative agency, this is real federal money in your wheelhouse."

### Contract 4 - HVAC
"$13 million in HVAC and plumbing with the Navy. NAVFAC is one of the largest buyers of mechanical services in the federal government. If you're in HVAC or plumbing, building relationships with NAVFAC primes should be a top priority."

### Contract 5 - Janitorial
"Janitorial is one of the most accessible entry points into federal contracting. These VA contracts are regional, they're recurring, and they're perfect for small businesses. The key is finding the right prime to partner with."

### Contract 6 - DOT IT
"Department of Transportation IT support. Multiple small businesses hold pieces of this - TTW Solutions, Econometrica, VHB. Under $10 million, very achievable. If you do IT support, help desk, system administration - this is your lane."

### Contract 7 - Fort Bragg
"Here's something interesting - there are 7 or more identical contracts at Fort Bragg, $6 million each, all for plumbing fixtures. Same work, different contract vehicles. When you find one opportunity, always look for similar ones."
