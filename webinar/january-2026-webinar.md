## Talking Points Script

### INTRO
"What's going on everybody, welcome to this month's Expiring Contracts breakdown. I'm Eric Coffie from GovCon Giants, and today I'm going to show you [$ AMOUNT] in federal contracts that are expiring in January 2026.

Now here's what makes January special - we're in the middle of Q2 FY2026. Agencies that had December spending deadlines are now looking at the contracts that expired and need to be rebid. Plus, with the holiday slowdown behind us, contracting offices are back in full swing.

If you're in federal contracting - whether you're a small business looking for subcontracting opportunities, or you're trying to position for prime contracts - this is information you NEED to know.

Because when these contracts expire, guess what happens? They get recompeted. And that means there's a window of opportunity for YOU to get in front of the primes who are going to bid on the new work.

Let's dive in."

### SECTION 1: Understanding Expiring Contracts
"First, let me explain what we're looking at here.

When the government awards a contract, it has an end date. Could be 1 year, could be 5 years. When that date hits, the contract expires.

Now, the government still needs this work done. So what do they do? They put out a NEW solicitation. This is called a RECOMPETE.

Here's the key insight: The prime contractors who want to win these recompetes need to put together their proposals NOW. And part of their proposal? Their small business subcontracting plan.

That means RIGHT NOW, these primes are looking for small business partners. They need to show the government they have a diverse team. And that's where YOU come in.

The timeline is usually:
- Contract expires
- 3-6 months later: New solicitation drops
- Primes have 30-60 days to respond
- Award 3-6 months after that

So if you reach out NOW, you're catching them at the perfect time - when they're actively building their teams."

### SECTION 2: Data Overview
"Alright, let's look at the numbers for January 2026.

We've got [X] unique prime contractors with expiring contracts.

Total value? $[X] BILLION dollars.

Let me break that down by agency:
- Department of Defense: [X contracts, $X value]
- Department of Veterans Affairs: [X contracts, $X value]
- Department of Health and Human Services: [X contracts, $X value]
- [Continue with top agencies]

And by industry:
- IT Services (NAICS 541511, 541512): [X contracts]
- Construction (NAICS 236220): [X contracts]
- Facilities/Janitorial (NAICS 561720): [X contracts]
- HVAC/Plumbing (NAICS 238220): [X contracts]

Whatever industry you're in, there's probably something expiring that's relevant to you."

### SECTION 3: Hot Opportunities
"Now let me show you some specific contracts that I think are great opportunities.

**OPPORTUNITY #1: [Contract Name]**
- Prime: [Company Name]
- Value: $X Million
- Agency: [Agency]
- NAICS: [Code - Description]

Why this is interesting: [Explanation]

Who should pursue this: [Types of businesses]

**OPPORTUNITY #2: [Contract Name]**
[Repeat format]

[Continue for 5-7 contracts]"

### SECTION 4: How to Take Action
"Alright, so you've seen the opportunities. Now what do you actually DO with this information?

**Step 1: Find contracts in YOUR NAICS code**
Filter the list by your NAICS. Don't waste time on contracts you can't compete for.

**Step 2: Research the prime contractor**
Go to their website. Look up their past performance. See what kind of work they do.

**Step 3: Find their Small Business Liaison Officer**
This is the person whose JOB it is to find small business partners. They WANT to hear from you.

**Step 4: Craft your outreach**
Don't just say 'I want to work with you.' Be specific:
- Reference the specific contract
- Explain what you bring to the table
- Show you've done your homework

**Step 5: Follow up**
One email isn't enough. Follow up in a week. Then again in two weeks. Be persistent but professional."
