**Tier 1 Prime Contractors:**
- 96.6% have full vendor registration portals
- Most use established platforms (SAP Ariba, Exostar, Coupa, SupplierOne, etc.)
- Formal registration processes with online portals

**Tier 2 Companies:**
- Most do NOT have public vendor registration portals
- Direct SBLO contact is the primary registration method
- Smaller companies with less formal procurement processes
- Faster go-to-market because direct relationships are key

## 🎯 Recommended Approach for Remaining Research

Since most Tier 2 companies don't have formal portals, the research should focus on:

1. **Quick Website Check:** Visit company website for "Suppliers" or "Vendors" section
2. **SBLO Contact:** Use existing SBLO email from tier2-high-priority-list.csv
3. **Documentation:** Mark as "Contact SBLO directly" if no portal found
4. **Exceptions:** Note any companies that DO have formal portals (like KPMG)

---

## 📊 Research Statistics

- **Total Companies:** 59
- **Batch 2 Complete:** 9 companies ✅
- **Batch 3 Partial:** 1 company (KPMG) ✅
- **Remaining:** ~49 companies
- **Estimated Completion Time:** 2-3 hours for remaining batches

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Continue Batch 3 Research:** Research remaining 9 companies
2. **Complete Batches 4-6:** Systematically research all remaining companies
3. **Data Cleanup:** Remove invalid entries (Contract, In Search Of:, https://, etc.)
4. **Create Final PDF:** Compile all researched companies into Tier 2 PDF list
5. **Update Batch CSV Files:** Populate all vendor_registration_url, portal_type, and notes columns

---

## 💡 Key Insight

**Tier 2 companies are faster go-to-market because:**
- Direct SBLO relationships (no portal bureaucracy)
- Smaller, more agile procurement processes
- Less competition than Tier 1 portals
- Personal connections matter more

**Action:** Focus on building relationships with SBLO contacts rather than portal registration for most Tier 2 companies.
