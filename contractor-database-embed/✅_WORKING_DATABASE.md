## 📋 EMBED CODE FOR MIGHTY NETWORKS

### Copy & Paste This:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://contractor-database-embed-a51o537kq-eric-coffies-projects.vercel.app/embed-page.html"
  width="100%"
  height="800px"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: none; border-radius: 8px;">
</iframe>
```

### Or As a Link:

```markdown
[🔍 Search 2,768 Federal Contractors →](https://contractor-database-embed-a51o537kq-eric-coffies-projects.vercel.app/embed-page.html)
```

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The issue was that `data-extract.js` contained the entire HTML page instead of just the JavaScript data. I've now extracted only the pure data array (lines 525-63562 from the original file).

Now the database loads instantly with all contractors visible!
