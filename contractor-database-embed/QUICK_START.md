## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Mighty Networks Limitation**: If you get "provider not supported" error, it means your Mighty Networks plan doesn't support iframe embeds. Use a link/button instead.

2. **Data Size**: The database contains all 2,768 contractors. Initial load may take 1-2 seconds.

3. **Updates**: This is a static snapshot of the GovCon Giants database. For updates, re-download from the original source.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"This provider is not supported"**
→ Use a link/button instead of embedding, or upgrade Mighty Networks plan

**Database not loading**
→ Make sure both `index.html` and `data-extract.js` are uploaded together

**Search not working**
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Styling looks broken**
→ Ensure complete HTML file is uploaded, not truncated
