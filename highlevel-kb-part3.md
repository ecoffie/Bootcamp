# BUYER PSYCHOLOGY - UNDERSTANDING THEIR WHY

## Why understand buyer psychology first?
Before recommending any solution, understand WHY they want government contracting. Their psychological state determines how we position our offer.

## The 5 Buyer Psychology Types

### Type 1: Rock Bottom Buyer
**Indicators:** "I just got laid off," "My business failed," "I need to make a change," "starting over"
**What they're buying:** A new identity. Escape from who they were.
**Response:** "A lot of our most successful clients came to government contracting after a major life change. When everything falls apart, it's the perfect time to build something new."

### Type 2: Almost There Buyer
**Indicators:** "I've taken other courses," "I know the basics," "What's actually working?" Already registered but no wins.
**What they're buying:** The missing piece that finally makes it click.
**Response:** "You've put in the work—you're not starting from zero. You need the specific strategy that's actually working right now, not more generic information."

### Type 3: Identity Buyer
**Indicators:** Excited about community, asks who else is involved, wants to be "in the room," talks about what they're "working on"
**What they're buying:** The label. Being "a government contractor."
**Response:** "You'd be joining a community of serious business owners actively winning contracts. You're not just learning—you're becoming someone who operates at a different level."

### Type 4: Escape Buyer
**Indicators:** "I hate my job," "I want to be my own boss," "I want freedom," comments about hating Mondays
**What they're buying:** The fantasy of a different life. Freedom.
**Response:** "Government contracting can be your exit strategy. Imagine picking your own projects, working with agencies you respect, building something that's yours."

### Type 5: Revenge Buyer
**Indicators:** "Everyone told me this wouldn't work," "I want to show them," "People doubted me"
**What they're buying:** Proof. The ability to say "I told you so."
**Response:** "I love that energy. When you land that first contract, those people who doubted you won't have shit to say. Let's make that happen."

## Questions to Uncover Buyer Psychology
- "What made you start looking into government contracting?"
- "What's going on in your life right now that brought you here?"
- "Why government contracting? Why now?"
- "What would winning a government contract mean for you?"
- "What happens if you don't figure this out?"
- "Who would be most surprised if you succeeded at this?"

## Listen for emotional triggers:
- **Rock Bottom:** Pain, loss, desperation, starting over
- **Almost There:** Frustration, "I've tried everything," seeking missing piece
- **Identity:** Belonging, community, being seen, labels
- **Escape:** Freedom, hatred of current situation
- **Revenge:** Proving people wrong, doubt from others

# 4-BUCKET PROSPECT ASSESSMENT

## How do you determine what help I need?
We use a simple framework based on where you are in your government contracting journey. There are basically four stages: people just getting started who need direction, people registered but unsure what industry to focus on, people registered but not winning contracts, and people who've won but want consistent growth. Each stage needs different support.

## Assessment: Bucket 1 - New and Need Direction
**Profile:** Knows about government contracting and anxious to get started but doesn't know where—state, local, federal, or what certifications to pursue.

**Key indicators:**
- "I keep hearing about government contracting but don't know where to start"
- "Should I do federal or start with local?"
- "What certifications do I need?"
- "I've been watching YouTube videos but I'm confused"

**Recommended solution:** Free Course, Group Coaching, or strategy call for clarity.

## Assessment: Bucket 2 - Registered but Unsure What Industry
**Profile:** Registered in SAM but not sure what industry to pick. Wants low-hanging fruit. May not have an established business yet.

**Key indicators:**
- "I'm registered but don't know what to sell"
- "What's the easiest thing to get started with?"
- "What industry has the most opportunity?"

**Qualifying questions:**
- Who in your network has a business?
- Do you want the financial responsibility of managing a business?
- Are you better at paperwork or doing the actual work?

**Recommended solution:** Opportunity Hunter (free), Bootcamp, Group Coaching Starter.

## Assessment: Bucket 3 - Registered but Not Winning
**Profile:** Registered in SAM, may have certifications, but not winning contracts. Frustrated, losing hope, needs encouragement.

**Key indicators:**
- "I have my SAM registration and certifications but nothing's happening"
- "I keep bidding but never win"
- "I'm frustrated and about to give up"

**Qualifying questions:**
- Are you using a bid/no-bid framework?
- Do you have a pipeline tracker?
- Are you tracking Task Order and IDIQ contracts (the 95% not on SAM)?

**Recommended solution:** Group Coaching Pro, Bootcamp, 1-on-1 Coaching.

## Assessment: Bucket 4 - Won but Need Consistent Growth
**Profile:** Won a few contracts but not consistent. Questions about growing, hiring, finding larger partners.

**Key indicators:**
- "I've won some contracts but it's inconsistent"
- "How do I grow from here?"
- "I want to go after bigger projects"

**Recommended solution:** 1-on-1 coaching or White Glove service.

## Quick Qualifying Questions
1. "Are you registered in SAM.gov?" (No = Bucket 1, Yes = continue)
2. "Have you won any government contracts?" (Yes = Bucket 4, No = continue)
3. "Do you know what you want to sell to the government?" (No = Bucket 2, Yes = Bucket 3)

## I'm registered in SAM.gov / I have my SAM registration
Great, that's an important first step done! Now let me ask you a couple quick questions to figure out exactly where you are and what you need next. Have you won any government contracts yet? And do you already know what products or services you want to sell to the government, or are you still figuring that out?

## Someone says they're registered in SAM - what's next?
When someone says they're registered in SAM, DO NOT immediately jump to NAICS codes. Instead, ask: 1) Have you won any contracts? 2) Do you know what you want to sell? Their answers determine which bucket they're in and what guidance they need.

# LEARNING STYLE ASSESSMENT

## How do you prefer to learn new things?
