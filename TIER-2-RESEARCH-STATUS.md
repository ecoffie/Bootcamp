## Why Tier 2 First?

Based on your strategy guide (`TIER-1-VS-TIER-2-STRATEGY-GUIDE.md`):

✅ **10-15x higher success rate** than Tier 1
✅ **Faster decisions** (3-6 months vs 12-18 months)
✅ **Less competition** (most small businesses overlook Tier 2)
✅ **More accessible** SBLOs (less overwhelmed)
✅ **Lower contract minimums** ($25K-$500K typical)
✅ **Better relationships** (partnership vs transactional)

**Bottom Line:** Tier 2 success is your fastest path to revenue AND Tier 1 credibility.
