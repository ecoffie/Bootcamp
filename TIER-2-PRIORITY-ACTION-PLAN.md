## 🎯 Tier 2 Priority Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Priority Tier 2 Companies (Top 20-30)
**Focus on companies marked "high" priority in your list:**
- These are most likely to need subcontractors quickly
- Better vendor portal infrastructure
- More accessible SBLO contacts
- Active contracts requiring small business partners

### Phase 2: Medium-Priority (Next 50-70)
**After Phase 1 success:**
- Expand to broader Tier 2 base
- Use learnings from Phase 1
- Scale outreach approach

### Phase 3: Remaining Companies (Balance)
**Ongoing research:**
- Complete full Tier 2 directory
- Build comprehensive database
- Long-term relationship building

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Identify Top Priority Tier 2 Companies
**Extract companies marked "high" priority:**
```bash
grep ",high" tier2-vendor-portal-searches.csv > tier2-high-priority.csv
```

### Step 2: Create Priority Batch Files
**Create focused batches for high-priority companies:**
- 5-10 companies per batch (smaller = faster research)
- Focus on companies with existing SBLO contacts
- Prioritize companies in your NAICS codes

### Step 3: Vendor Portal Research
**Research approach:**
1. Use web search for each company: `"[Company Name]" supplier portal vendor registration`
2. Check company websites for supplier/small business pages
3. Look for registration forms or vendor portals
4. Document portal URLs, registration type, and notes

### Step 4: SBLO Contact Verification
**For companies with existing contacts:**
- Verify email addresses are current
- Check if SBLO is still active
- Identify additional contact methods
- Note preferred contact method

### Step 5: Quick Registration
**Immediate registration actions:**
- Register in vendor portals for top 10 companies TODAY
- Upload company profile, certifications, capabilities
- Submit capability statements
- Follow up with SBLO emails within 24-48 hours
