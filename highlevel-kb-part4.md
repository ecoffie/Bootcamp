# OBJECTION RESPONSES

## Response: "I can do this myself"
You absolutely can. The question is whether you want to spend time learning a new system or focus on what you do best while someone experienced handles the complexity. Most DIY attempts either succeed after significant time investment or hit frustrations that cost months. Even if you want to do most yourself, a strategy call can give you a roadmap.

## Response: "This sounds expensive"
What's your frame of reference? Registration itself is free. Where businesses spend money is professional help to avoid mistakes and save time. A registration error delays you weeks. Missing a certification opportunity costs you a set-aside contract. Think of it as investment in getting to revenue faster. Let's discuss what you actually need.

## Response: "I don't trust consultants"
I get it. Some people in this industry overpromise and underdeliver. Here's what I can tell you about {{BusinessName}}: we don't guarantee contracts because no one honestly can. We don't charge for free things. We're upfront about realistic timelines. Have a conversation with us, ask hard questions, talk to past clients. If something feels off, trust your gut.

## Response: "I don't want to waste time"
Neither do we. A strategy call takes 30 minutes. We'll assess whether government contracting is realistic for your business right now. If it's not, we'll tell you—there's no point wasting time on something that won't work. Some businesses aren't ready yet, and that's okay. But if there's a fit, we show you a direct path.

## Response: "Is this a scam?"
Fair question. There are scammers who prey on small businesses. Red flags: anyone guaranteeing contracts, charging for free things like SAM registration, pressuring immediate payment, or requesting sensitive information too early. We help with the process and charge reasonable fees for expertise. You can verify us. Government contracting itself is legitimate—hundreds of billions awarded annually.

## Response: "What if I don't win anything?"
That's a real concern. There are no guarantees—you can do everything right and not win. That's true in any competition. What we do is put you in the best position: properly registered, pursuing right opportunities, submitting competitive proposals, learning from losses. Most businesses don't win their first bid, but each attempt builds experience. This is a long-term strategy, not a one-shot gamble.

## Response: "I need to think about it"
Of course—take the time you need. While thinking, consider: government contracting rewards businesses that start early. Registration takes time, certifications take time, relationships take time. Businesses winning contracts this year started preparing last year. No pressure to decide today, but don't let "think about it" become "forget about it."

## Response: "I tried this before and it didn't work"
Tell me more about what happened. Common issues: registration got stuck, couldn't find fitting opportunities, bid but never won, got overwhelmed. These are all solvable. Sometimes it's approach—wrong places or opportunities. Sometimes it's needing guidance past sticking points. What happened before doesn't predict what happens next.

# BOOKING LANGUAGE

## Booking: When prospect is ready
It sounds like you're ready to move forward. The best next step is a strategy call where we go deeper on your specific situation, map out registrations, certifications, and opportunity strategy, and give you a clear action plan. Let me get you on the calendar. What does your availability look like this week?

## Booking: When prospect is confused
I can tell there's a lot to take in—government contracting has a learning curve. Rather than cover everything now, let me suggest a strategy call focused on your specific situation. We'll cut through the noise and tell you exactly what applies to your business. Would you have 30 minutes this week?

## Booking: When value is demonstrated
I'm glad this has been helpful. General information only goes so far—what moves the needle is a strategy specifically for your business. On a strategy call, we look at what you sell, your registration status, which certifications fit, what opportunities exist. Then you have an actual plan. Let me get you scheduled.

## Booking: Soft close for hesitant prospects
No pressure at all. If you want to think about it, I can send information to review. When ready, book a call at {{Website}} or call {{PhoneNumber}}. Is there anything else I can answer today?

## Booking: For busy prospects
I know you're busy running your business. The strategy call is just 30 minutes—pick a time that works. We'll make it count. Would a calendar link help? You can book whenever convenient.

## Booking: For researchers
Sounds like you're still in research mode, and that's fine. When ready to get serious, a strategy call turns research into action. In the meantime, anything specific you'd like me to explain?

## Booking: Direct close
The next step is scheduling your strategy call. Book directly at {{ConsultationLink}}, or I can check availability now. Which works better?

# GETTING STARTED

## What happens after I sign up?
After sign-up: kickoff call to gather business information and goals, document collection, registration completion if needed, strategy development for certifications and opportunities, then active pursuit together.

## How much of my time will this take?
At minimum, you'll provide documents, make decisions about certifications and opportunities, and prepare proposals. Maybe 2-4 hours per week during active pursuit. We handle the heavy lifting, but you can't be completely hands-off.

## What documents do you need from me?
For registration: business formation documents, EIN verification, bank account information, tax returns, and company officer information. For certifications, requirements vary—we provide a specific checklist.

## What does the consultation include?
Our consultation is a 30-minute call where we understand your business, assess your registration and certification status, discuss your goals, identify potential opportunities and realistic timelines, recommend next steps, and answer your questions.

## What should I have ready for the call?
It helps to know how long you've been in business, what products or services you offer, whether you've done government work before, and whether you've started any registrations. But even if you're just curious, that's fine.

## How do I book a consultation?
You can book directly at {{ConsultationLink}} or call us at {{PhoneNumber}}. We'll assess your situation and create an action plan.
