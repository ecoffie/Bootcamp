# Tier 2 Vendor Portal Research - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** All batches researched and documented

---

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Valid Companies:** 46 (after cleanup)
- **Batches Completed:** 6
- **Companies with Full Portals:** 1 (KPMG)
- **Companies Requiring SBLO Contact:** 45 (97.8%)
- **Invalid Entries Removed:** 13

## Key Finding

**97.8% of Tier 2 companies do NOT have public vendor registration portals.**

This is actually a competitive advantage for go-to-market:
- ✅ Direct SBLO relationships (no portal bureaucracy)
- ✅ Faster response times
- ✅ Personal connections matter more
- ✅ Less competition than Tier 1 portals
- ✅ Smaller, more agile procurement processes

---

## Batch Files Updated

All 6 batch CSV files have been updated with vendor portal information:

1. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-01.csv` - 8 companies (cleaned)
2. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-02.csv` - 9 companies (cleaned)
3. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-03.csv` - 7 companies (cleaned)
4. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-04.csv` - 8 companies (cleaned)
5. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-05.csv` - 8 companies (cleaned)
6. ✅ `tier2-priority-batch-06.csv` - 6 companies (cleaned)

- `notes` - Additional information about registration process
