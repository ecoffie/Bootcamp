# GENERAL OVERVIEW

## What is government contracting?
Government contracting is when federal, state, or local government agencies buy products and services from private businesses. The federal government alone spends over $700 billion every year buying from businesses like yours. A portion of that is specifically set aside for small businesses.

## What kinds of things does the government buy?
Almost everything. IT services, construction, office supplies, food services, consulting, marketing, janitorial services, security, training, healthcare services, transportation, and more. If there's a business that provides it, there's likely a government agency that buys it.

## Is government contracting only for big companies?
No, that's one of the biggest myths. The federal government is required by law to award at least 23% of contracts to small businesses. That's hundreds of billions of dollars. Many agencies have goals even higher than that, and there are special programs that give small businesses an advantage.

## How is this different from selling to regular customers?
There are key differences. The government has specific rules about how they buy—it's more formal. You need to be registered in certain systems before you can bid. Contracts are often larger and longer-term, meaning more stable revenue. And government agencies tend to be repeat buyers once you're in.

## Where do I start with government contracting?
Start with registration. You need to be registered in SAM.gov—the System for Award Management. It's free and required before you can do business with the federal government.

## Do I need a special license to sell to the government?
No special license required. But you need to complete certain registrations and maintain your business in good standing. Think of registration as getting your credentials verified so the government knows you're a legitimate business.

## Can I sell to multiple levels of government?
Yes. You can sell to federal agencies, state agencies, counties, cities, school districts, public universities, and more. Each level has its own registration requirements, but many small businesses work across multiple levels.

## How long does it take to get a government contract?
Most businesses see their first real opportunity within 6-12 months of getting properly set up. Some move faster, especially with set-asides or subcontracting. The key is being realistic—this is a marathon, not a sprint.

## Why does government contracting take so long?
The government moves deliberately because they're spending taxpayer money. They have rules for fairness. But once you're in the system with a track record, things move faster. Your first contract is the hardest—after that, past performance makes winning easier.

# MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS

## Is it true that government contracting is too complicated for small businesses?
No. It has a learning curve, but thousands of small businesses figure it out every year. The key is understanding the process step by step rather than trying everything at once.

## Do I need connections or lobbyists to win government contracts?
No. Most government contracts are awarded through open competition. Opportunities are publicly posted. Relationships can help, but the process is designed to be transparent and give everyone a fair shot.

## Does the government take forever to pay?
Actually, federal agencies are required by law to pay within 30 days for most contracts. Compared to some private sector clients, the government can be more reliable.

## Do I have to be the lowest bidder to win?
Not always. Many contracts are awarded based on "best value," meaning they consider quality, experience, past performance, and other factors—not just price.

## Do certifications guarantee contracts?
No. Certifications open doors but don't guarantee anything. Think of them as an advantage, not a golden ticket. You still need to find opportunities, submit strong proposals, and deliver quality work.

# ELIGIBILITY

## Who is eligible to sell to the federal government?
To sell to the federal government, your business needs to be a legal business entity, have a Tax ID number, be in good standing with no debarments, have a physical US address for most contracts, and be able to accept electronic payments.

## Can any type of business sell to the government?
Almost any type. Service businesses, product companies, manufacturers, distributors, consultants, construction companies, technology firms—the government buys from all of them.

## I just started my business. Can I pursue government contracts?
You can register right away, but winning contracts is harder without a track record. Many new businesses start by subcontracting—working under an established contractor to build experience.

## Does my business need to be a certain size?
For small business set-asides, yes. The definition of "small" varies by industry using SBA size standards. Some industries define small as under 500 employees; others use annual revenue thresholds ranging from $1 million to $47 million or more.

## I work from home. Is that a problem?
Not necessarily. Many government contractors work from home, especially in consulting, IT, and professional services. You need a legitimate business address for registration—a home address works for many businesses.

## What if I'm too big to be considered small?
You'd compete as a large business for unrestricted contracts. You could also pursue mentor-protégé arrangements or joint ventures with certified small businesses. But most businesses asking this actually qualify as small—the thresholds are higher than people expect.

---

# SIZE STANDARDS

## How is "small business" defined for government contracting?
The Small Business Administration sets size standards for every industry using NAICS codes. Depending on your industry, the threshold is either employee count (typically 100-1,500) or average annual revenue over 3-5 years (ranging from $1 million to $47 million or more).

## What's a NAICS code?
NAICS stands for North American Industry Classification System. It's a 6-digit code that identifies your business type. You might have multiple codes if you offer different services. The code determines your size standard and what opportunities you can bid on.

## How many NAICS codes should I have?
Include every code that honestly represents work you can do. Most businesses have 3-10 codes. Don't go overboard with codes you can't perform, but don't be too narrow or you'll miss opportunities.

## How do I find my NAICS codes?
The Census Bureau has a search tool, or Google "NAICS code" plus what you do. Look at what competitors use. You can also describe your services during a consultation and we'll help identify the right codes.

## Can I add NAICS codes later?
Yes. You can update your SAM profile anytime to add or remove NAICS codes.

# READINESS

## What are signs I'm ready for government contracting?
You're likely ready if you've been in business 1-2 years, have a track record of delivering similar work, can handle cash flow (government pays after work is done), have required insurance, have capacity for additional work, have organized financials, and can dedicate time to the pursuit process.

## How much money do I need to get started?
Registration is free. The real costs are time and potentially professional help. You should have enough working capital to deliver on a contract before getting paid—typically 30-60 days of expenses. Some contracts require bonds or specific insurance.

## Do I need past government experience to win contracts?
Not always. You can use commercial past performance—work for private sector clients—to show you can deliver. Some contracts are set aside for businesses without government experience. Subcontracting is another way to build past performance first.

## When should I NOT pursue government contracting yet?
Government contracting might not be right yet if your business is less than 6 months old, you're having cash flow problems, you lack proper documentation, you can't clearly describe your services, you're looking for quick money, or your current workload leaves no capacity.

# SAM.GOV REGISTRATION

## What is SAM.gov?
SAM.gov is the System for Award Management—the official government database of businesses eligible for federal contracts. If you're not in SAM, you can't get paid on a federal contract. It's free to register and requires annual renewal.

## Is SAM.gov registration really free?
Yes, 100% free. If anyone charges you for SAM registration, that's a red flag. What's not free is your time—registration takes several hours and requires gathering information. Some businesses hire help for the complexity, not because there's a fee.

## How long does SAM registration take?
With all documents ready and no errors, it can be approved in 7-10 business days. But most people hit snags—wrong addresses, mismatched information, missing documentation. Realistic timeline is 2-4 weeks.

## What do I need to register in SAM.gov?
You'll need: legal business name and address, Tax ID (EIN or SSN), banking information for electronic payments, NAICS codes, product/service codes, size status information, and company officers/ownership information.

## What causes delays in SAM registration?
Common issues: business name doesn't exactly match IRS records, address mismatches between databases, missing or incorrect banking information, not having a UEI before starting, incomplete NAICS codes, and errors in company structure section.

## What if my SAM registration is rejected?
You'll get a notice explaining why. Common reasons include entity validation failures, IRS matching problems, or missing information. You can fix issues and resubmit. The Federal Service Desk can help if you're stuck.

## Do I need to renew SAM.gov?
Yes, every year. If you let it lapse, you can't receive contract payments until renewed. Set a calendar reminder 60 days before expiration.

## My SAM registration has been pending for weeks. What should I do?
Log in and check for error messages or information requests. If stuck in validation, contact the Federal Service Desk. Common issues are IRS validation problems—if your business name doesn't match their records exactly, it gets flagged.

# UEI AND CAGE CODE

## What is a UEI?
The UEI is your Unique Entity Identifier—a 12-character ID for your business in the federal contracting system. It replaced the old DUNS number in 2022. Every business needs one for SAM.gov registration.

## How do I get a UEI?
You request it during the SAM.gov registration process. You can also get it before completing full registration by starting entity registration on SAM.gov. It's usually assigned within a few days, sometimes instantly.

## I have an old DUNS number. Does that still work?
DUNS numbers were replaced by UEI in April 2022. If you were registered before then, you were assigned a UEI automatically. If starting fresh, you'll get a UEI through SAM.gov—no DUNS needed.

## Is there a cost for the UEI?
No, the UEI is assigned through SAM.gov at no charge.

## What is a CAGE code?
The CAGE code is a 5-character Commercial and Government Entity Code used by the Department of Defense and NATO. It's assigned automatically when you complete SAM.gov registration.

## Do I need a CAGE code if I'm not doing defense work?
You'll get one anyway through SAM registration at no extra cost or steps. Even if focused on civilian agencies now, having it means you're ready if defense opportunities arise.

# STATE AND LOCAL REGISTRATION

## Does federal registration cover state and local governments?
No. Federal registration (SAM.gov) doesn't automatically register you with state or local governments. Each state has its own vendor registration system, and cities/counties may have separate ones.

## Do I need to register in every state?
Only states where you want to pursue opportunities. Start with your home state and neighboring states where you can realistically work. Some contracts require you to already be registered before bidding.

## Are state certifications different from federal certifications?
Yes. Federal certifications like 8(a) or SDVOSB are separate from state MBE or DBE programs. Some states recognize federal certifications; some don't. You may need both for state and local work.

## How do I find my state's vendor registration?
Search for "[Your State] vendor registration" or "[Your State] procurement portal." Most states have an online system with names like VendorLink, BidNet, or state-specific portals.

---

# CERTIFICATIONS OVERVIEW

## What do certifications do for my business?
Certifications give you an advantage when competing for government contracts. Certain contracts are "set aside"—meaning only certified businesses can bid. Instead of 50 competitors, you might have 10.

## Do certifications guarantee I'll win contracts?
No. Certifications open doors but don't do the work for you. You still need to find opportunities, submit competitive proposals, and deliver quality work. Don't chase certifications you don't qualify for.

## Can I have multiple certifications?
Yes. Many businesses stack certifications. A Black woman veteran in a HUBZone could potentially qualify for WOSB, 8(a), SDVOSB, and HUBZone. More certifications mean more set-aside opportunities.

## Should I get certified before I register?
No—you need SAM.gov registration first. Most certification programs require an active SAM registration.

## Will the SBA send me contracts after I'm certified?
No. SBA doesn't award contracts—agencies do. SBA provides certifications and support, but you're responsible for finding and pursuing opportunities.

# WOSB AND EDWOSB

## What is WOSB certification?
WOSB is Women-Owned Small Business certification. It's a federal program that sets aside contracts for women-owned businesses.

## What is EDWOSB certification?
EDWOSB is Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business. It has the same requirements as WOSB plus an economic threshold—personal net worth under $850,000, excluding primary residence and business ownership.

## What are the requirements for WOSB?
At least 51% owned and controlled by one or more women, women manage day-to-day operations and make long-term decisions, meets small business size standards, and is a for-profit entity.

## What's the difference between WOSB and EDWOSB?
WOSB is for any women-owned small business meeting ownership and control requirements. EDWOSB adds an economic threshold—net worth under $850,000, not counting your home and business share. EDWOSB accesses more set-aside opportunities.

## How do I get WOSB certified?
Two paths: self-certification through the SBA's online portal (free), or using an SBA-approved Third Party Certifier (has a fee but can be faster). Both require uploading documents showing ownership and control.

## How long does WOSB certification take?
Self-certification typically takes 2-4 weeks through SBA. Third-party certification can be 4-8 weeks. Having clean documentation—operating agreements, bylaws, tax returns—speeds things up.

---

# SDVOSB

## What is SDVOSB certification?
SDVOSB is Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business certification. There are significant set-aside opportunities, especially with the VA and other federal agencies.

## What are the requirements for SDVOSB?
At least 51% owned by service-disabled veterans, a service-disabled veteran controls management and daily operations, the veteran holds the highest officer position (or can explain why not), and meets small business size standards.

## What counts as "service-disabled" for SDVOSB?
A disability incurred or aggravated during active duty in the armed forces. This needs documentation—typically a VA disability rating of any percentage, or DOD documentation.

## Where do I get SDVOSB certified?
Through the SBA's Veteran Small Business Certification program. The VA used to handle this but it moved to SBA. You'll upload military documentation, disability documentation, and business ownership documents.

## How long does SDVOSB certification take?
Typically 4-8 weeks through SBA. Having all documents in order speeds things up. Common delays come from incomplete military records or unclear ownership documentation.

# 8(a) PROGRAM

## What is the 8(a) program?
The 8(a) Business Development Program is SBA's premier certification for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. It's a 9-year program providing access to sole-source contracts, set-asides, mentoring, and business development assistance.

## Why is 8(a) considered powerful?
8(a) opens doors to contracts that can be awarded directly to you without competition—called sole-source awards up to $4.5 million for services or $7 million for manufacturing. It's harder to get but offers serious benefits.

## What are the requirements for 8(a) certification?
Owned (at least 51%) and controlled by U.S. citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged, owner demonstrates social disadvantage, owner demonstrates economic disadvantage (net worth under $850,000), business operational for at least 2 years (can be waived), shows potential for success, and owner is of good character.

## Who qualifies as socially disadvantaged for 8(a)?
SBA presumes social disadvantage for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans. Others can qualify by demonstrating they've experienced bias or chronic prejudice, including women of any race with additional documentation.

## How long does 8(a) certification take?
Typically 3-6 months. It's the most involved application—expect extensive documentation of personal finances, business history, tax returns, and often a personal narrative. Many businesses get help because requirements are complex.

## What happens during the 9 years of 8(a)?
Years 1-4 are the developmental stage with maximum support. Years 5-9 are the transitional stage where you become more self-sufficient. You can only be in the program once, so timing matters.

## Is 8(a) worth the effort?
For many businesses, yes. Sole-source contracts without competition are powerful. But you need to actively pursue opportunities—the certification alone doesn't bring contracts to you.

# HUBZONE

## What is HUBZone certification?
HUBZone certification is based on location. If your business and employees are in certain designated areas, you can access HUBZone set-asides. It directs government spending to economically challenged communities.

## What are the requirements for HUBZone?
Small business with principal office in a HUBZone, at least 35% of employees reside in HUBZones, and owned and controlled by U.S. citizens.

## How do I know if I'm in a HUBZone?
SBA has a HUBZone map tool online. Enter your address and it tells you immediately. Rural areas, urban empowerment zones, and Native American lands may qualify. Boundaries can change annually, so verify before applying.

## What if my area loses HUBZone designation after I'm certified?
Once certified, you get some protection. If your area loses designation, you typically have 3 years to maintain certification while transitioning or relocating. Check current rules as they can change.

## How long does HUBZone certification take?
Typically 2-4 months. You'll document your principal office location and employee residence information. SBA may do site visits.

# STATE CERTIFICATIONS

## What are MBE, WBE, and DBE certifications?
MBE (Minority Business Enterprise), WBE (Women's Business Enterprise), and DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) are state and local certification programs. They're separate from federal certifications and give access to state/local set-asides.

## Do federal certifications count at the state level?
Sometimes. Some states accept or expedite applications if you have federal certifications. Others require their own process regardless. Check with your specific state's certification office.

## Which state certifications should I get?
Start with your home state and states where you realistically want to work. Focus on certifications you actually qualify for that align with opportunities in your industry.

---

# WHICH CERTIFICATION FIRST

## Which certification should I pursue first?
Consider: which do you clearly qualify for, what level of government are you targeting, how competitive is your industry, what's your timeline, and what's your capacity. Don't chase certifications you'll fail to get.

## I'm a woman-owned business. Where should I start?
WOSB is often a good first step—it's straightforward and opens doors. If you also meet economic disadvantage thresholds, consider EDWOSB for more opportunities.

## I'm a veteran. What certification should I pursue?
If you have a service-connected disability, SDVOSB is powerful with significant set-asides. Start there if you qualify.

## Should I wait to pursue 8(a)?
Some businesses wait until more established to get maximum value from the 9-year window. Others want the benefits as early as possible. Consider your readiness to actively pursue opportunities when deciding timing.
