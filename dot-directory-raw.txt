DOT Subcontracting Directory


Overview
Large prime contractors receiving Federal contract awards valued over $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) are required to established plans and goals for subcontracting with small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small business concerns. 
OSDBU is proud to present the Fiscal Year 2025 Subcontracting Directory. This directory is published as a marketing aid for small businesses, to participate in DOT procurements as subcontractors. In this directory, you will find listings of major DOT prime contractors with approved subcontracting plans. It identifies the prime contractors' name and address, company subcontracting liaison representative and telephone numbers and description of the project or items to be subcontracted. Contact should be made with the company's subcontracting liaison representative who has knowledge of the contractor's subcontracting plan and goals. This person can advise you on how your firm can join their subcontracting vendor's team.
All of us at OSDBU wish you success in your business endeavors.
