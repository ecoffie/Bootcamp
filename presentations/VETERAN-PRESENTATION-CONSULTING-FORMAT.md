# Consulting-Grade Slide Format Specification
## GovCon Veteran Presentation — McKinsey / BCG / KPMG Style

**Purpose:** Define the slide format and visual language so the veteran GovCon deck looks and behaves like a top-consulting (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, KPMG, Deloitte) presentation: one idea per slide, action-oriented titles, and visuals that explain concepts instead of walls of text.

---

## 1. Core Principles (from MBB & Big Four)

| Principle | What it means for our deck |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Pyramid Principle** | Start with the answer. The slide title is the main takeaway; everything below supports it. |
| **One idea per slide** | Each slide has exactly one message. If you can’t state it in one sentence, split the slide. |
| **Action titles, not labels** | Title = conclusion or “so what,” not a topic label. e.g. “Federal agencies spend $700B+ yearly—23% set aside for small business” not “What is government contracting?” |
| **Visuals over bullets** | Use icons, diagrams, and simple charts to explain concepts. Bullets only when they support a single visual. |
| **Executive glance test** | In 3 seconds, someone should get the main point from the title + visual. |

---

## 2. Slide Anatomy (consulting layout)

Every content slide uses a consistent structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TITLE BAR (action title, 1–2 lines max, same position)      │  ← Conclusion / main message
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│   VISUAL ZONE                                                │
│   • One central visual: icon, diagram, chart, or number     │
│   • Explains the concept; not decorative                     │
│   • Annotations/callouts only if they reinforce the title    │
│                                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SUPPORTING LINE (optional)                                 │  ← One short sentence max
│  e.g. “No lobbyists or insiders required.”                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Title bar:** Same height and position on every slide. Font weight and size consistent.
- **Visual zone:** Dominant. Chart, diagram, icon set, or single big number. No long paragraphs.
- **Supporting line:** Optional. One short takeaway or qualifier, not a paragraph.

## 3. Action Titles — Rules and Examples

| Do | Don’t |
|----|--------|
| State the conclusion or insight | Use a topic label |
| Use active voice, be specific | Be vague or passive |
| Keep to one line (max ~15 words) | Write long sentences |
| Answer “So what?” | Describe what the slide “is about” |

**Examples for our deck:**

| Old (label) | New (action title) |
|-------------|--------------------|
| What Is Government Contracting? | Federal agencies spend $700B+ yearly—23% set aside for small business. |
| The Opportunity | Every opportunity over $25K is public on SAM.gov; same list for everyone. |
| VOSB: Veteran-Owned Small Business | VOSB = 51% veteran-owned, veteran in control; state and federal preferences apply. |
| SDVOSB: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned | SDVOSB adds service-connected disability; unlocks VA Veterans First and DoD 3% goal. |
| Where to Get SDVOSB Certified | SBA runs Veteran Small Business Certification (4–8 weeks); one place, free. |
| Why Your Veteran Status Matters | Set-asides shrink the pool of bidders—no backdoor needed, just find and respond. |
| Where to Start | SAM.gov first: register (free), then search Contract Opportunities. |
| What Is a NAICS Code? | NAICS = 6-digit code for your industry; government uses it to classify contracts and size. |
| How to Find Your NAICS Codes | Use census.gov/naics or Google “NAICS code” + what you do; most use 3–10 codes. |
| Where Are the Opportunities? | SAM.gov → Contract Opportunities: search by keywords and NAICS, filter by set-aside. |
| How to Find Opportunities Yourself | Save your search and turn on email alerts; check Sources Sought and RFIs. |
| Free Resource: SAM.gov | SAM.gov = register + search opportunities; free, required, save searches for alerts. |
| Free Resource: USAspending.gov | USAspending.gov = who awarded what, to whom; use it to see who’s buying and find partners. |
| Free Resource: SBA.gov | SBA.gov = SDVOSB certification, size standards by NAICS, free courses and guides. |
| Free Resource: VA OSDBU | VA OSDBU (va.gov/osdbu) = Veterans First, prime directories, outreach events. |
| Free Resource: APEX Accelerators | APEX = free GovCon counseling in every state; SAM, certifications, strategy. |
| Free Resource: SBA SUBNet | SUBNet = primes’ subcontract postings; filter by state and NAICS to get in the door. |
| Use AI to Speed Up Research | Use one prompt: “List SDVOSB set-asides in [your industry] in the last 90 days.” |
| AI Prompts for Outreach | “Write a short capability email to [Agency] for [your service]. We are an SDVOSB.” |
| Best Agencies to Target | VA (Veterans First), DoD (3% SDVOSB), DHS, GSA—match your NAICS to their goals. |
| What Is the NDAA? | NDAA = annual defense bill; Congress adds small business rules that apply government-wide. |
| What Do the New Thresholds Mean? | Sole-source = award without full competition; 2026: up to $8M services, $10M manufacturing for SDVOSB. |
| Your Next Steps | Register in SAM.gov, set alerts, contact VA OSDBU and APEX, respond to one Sources Sought or RFI. |

## 4. Visuals That Explain Concepts

Each slide type gets a clear visual role:

| Slide type | Visual approach | Example for our deck |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Big number / scale** | One number + short label | “$700B+” or “23%” with “Federal contract spend” / “Set aside for small business” |
| **Definition / concept** | Icon or simple diagram | NAICS = one icon (e.g. tag/label) + “6-digit code for your industry” |
| **Process / steps** | Horizontal or vertical flow (3–5 steps) | Register → NAICS → Search → Filter set-aside → Save alerts |
| **Comparison** | Two columns or two icons | VOSB vs SDVOSB: two cards or icons with one line each |
| **List of resources** | One icon per resource (no long text) | 6 icons: SAM, USAspending, SBA, VA OSDBU, APEX, SUBNet |
| **Agencies** | Logo-style blocks or icons | VA, DoD, DHS, GSA with one line each |
| **Takeaway / close** | Single icon or short quote | Checkmark or “You can land millions—without special connections.” |

**Visual discipline:**
- One dominant visual per slide (one diagram, one chart, or one set of icons).
- Icons: simple, same style (e.g. outline or flat), 2–3 colors max.
- No clip art; no decorative images that don’t support the title.
- Use color to highlight the one thing that matters (e.g. green for “you” or “opportunity”).

## 5. Design System

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| **Aspect ratio** | 16:9 |
| **Background** | White or very light gray (#f8f9fa) |
| **Title bar** | Dark bar (e.g. navy #1b365d) with white text; or bold dark text on light. Same position every slide. |
| **Fonts** | One sans-serif (e.g. Inter). Title: bold, 24–28pt. Supporting: regular, 16–18pt. |
| **Colors** | Primary: green (#8BC34A) for emphasis/CTAs. Secondary: navy (#1b365d). Neutral: gray for body. Use one accent per slide. |
| **Whitespace** | Margins and padding consistent; don’t fill the slide. |
| **Grid** | Align title, visual, and supporting line to a simple grid (e.g. 12-column). |

---

## 6. Deck Structure (storyline)

1. **Title slide** — Presentation title + subtitle (e.g. “A practical guide for veteran-owned & SDVOSB businesses”).
2. **Agenda (optional)** — 3–5 section titles only; no paragraphs.
3. **Situation** — What is GovCon? Why it matters (big number + “public, no connections”).
4. **Complication / Opportunity** — Set-asides, VOSB vs SDVOSB, why certification matters.
5. **Answer / How** — Where to start (SAM, NAICS), where opportunities live, how to find them.
6. **Resources** — One slide per resource or one slide with 6 icons + one line each.
7. **Enablers** — AI prompts, best agencies, NDAA thresholds.
8. **Recommendations** — Next steps (3–5 actions max).
9. **Close** — Thank you + one-line takeaway.

## 7. What Changes in the Current Deck

| Current issue | Change |
|---------------|--------|
| Topic-style titles | Replace with action titles (conclusion first). |
| Text-only slides | Add one central visual per slide (icon, diagram, or number). |
| No visual hierarchy | Add a clear title bar + visual zone + optional supporting line. |
| Bullet-heavy resources | Use one icon per resource + one line; or one slide per resource with one visual. |
| “What is NDAA” / “What thresholds mean” | Keep one idea per slide; use one simple diagram or number for thresholds. |

---

## 8. Implementation Notes (HTML/CSS)

- **Title bar:** Fixed height (e.g. 72px), full-width, dark background, white text, padding consistent.
- **Visual zone:** Min-height (e.g. 280px), centered content: one `<figure>` or icon group or chart container.
- **Supporting line:** One `<p>` under the visual, smaller font, muted color.
- **Icons:** Use a single icon set (e.g. Heroicons, Phosphor, or simple SVG) and CSS to size/color.
- **Charts/numbers:** Use a single big number + label (e.g. “$700B” + “Federal contract spend”) with large type.
- **Flows:** Use flexbox or grid to lay out 3–5 steps with arrows (→) or a simple SVG path.

## 9. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Every slide has an **action title** (conclusion, not label).
- [ ] Every slide has **one idea**; one sentence test passes.
- [ ] Every slide has a **visual** (icon, diagram, or number) that explains the concept.
- [ ] **No long paragraphs**; at most one short supporting line.
- [ ] **Title bar + visual zone + optional line** layout is consistent.
- [ ] **Color and typography** follow the design system.
- [ ] **Storyline** flows: Situation → Opportunity → How → Resources → Next steps → Close.

This format, applied consistently, will make the deck feel like a multi-million-dollar consulting presentation: clear, visual, and built for retention and decision-making.
