## The 3 hook frameworks that work best for this topic

**“They have X days to spend Y dollars or lose it.”**  
Why it works: urgency + scale + stakes.

### 2) **Proof-led claim**
**“I’m going to show you the exact agencies + sources.”**  
Why it works: credibility + reduces skepticism.

### 3) **Path to action**
**“By the end of this live you’ll have your targets + next steps.”**  
Why it works: clear outcome + reduces “so what?”

- **Title:** #2
- **Thumbnail:** Option A

  > “The government has **90 days** to spend **$82 billion** or lose it. Tonight I’m showing you **where it’s sitting** and what a small business can do **this week** to get positioned.”

### Combo 2 (credibility-first)
- **Title:** #4
- **Thumbnail:** Option E
- **Hook:**
  > “FY2026 NDAA was signed **December 18th**. I pulled the Treasury and spending data—**$82.8B** is sitting unobligated. I’m going to show you the **exact agencies**, then give you the **steps to move**.”

### Combo 3 (tactical SAM.gov angle)
- **Title:** #5
- **Thumbnail:** Option C
- **Hook:**

- **Thumbnail:** Option D

## Opening minute scripts (choose 1)
**Goal:** promise + proof + payoff. No long intro.

### Opening A (direct + urgent)
> “The government is sitting on **$82.8B** right now—and they have roughly **90 days** to obligate it in Q1.  
> I’m going to show you **where the money is sitting**, what the FY2026 NDAA changed, and what you should do **this week** to get positioned.  
> If you’re a small business owner, stay with me—because this window opens once a year, and it closes fast.”

### Opening B (proof-led)
> “I’m not guessing. I pulled the Treasury data and the spending sources—and the numbers are clear: **$82.8B** in unobligated balances across key agencies.  
> In the next 20 minutes I’ll show you the **agency list**, the new **$8M/$10M** thresholds, and I’ll give you free resources to start today.”

### Opening C (challenge-led)
> “By the end of this live, you’ll have **one target agency**, **one opportunity path**, and **one action** you’ll take in the next 24 hours.  
> Because the money is there—**$82B**—but only the contractors who move fast will benefit.”

## Retention beats (use these on purpose)
Use these to keep people from dropping.

- **Minute 2:** “In 60 seconds I’ll show you the exact agency list—don’t leave yet.”
- **Right before the table:** “This is where most people realize they’ve been targeting the wrong agencies.”
- **Before sole source thresholds:** “This part is *specifically* good news for certified small businesses.”
- **Before freebies:** “I’m going to give you 5 downloads—stay with me and I’ll show you how to use each one.”

---

## “Show me the receipts” credibility block (quick)
Use this once to reduce skepticism, then move on.

**Primary sources to mention on stream (don’t over-explain):**
- Treasury Fiscal Data (Monthly Treasury Statement)
- USASpending.gov (agency spending / obligations)
- Congress.gov (FY2026 NDAA text)
- CBO + GAO (supporting context)

**One-liner:**
> “This isn’t opinion—these are public sources: Treasury + USASpending + the NDAA text.”

---

## The “money table” moment (how to present it)
**Pattern:** show → interpret → action.

1) **Show:** “Here’s where the money is sitting.”  
2) **Interpret:** “These are the agencies under the most pressure in Q1.”  
3) **Action:** “Pick 1–3 agencies that match your NAICS and certifications.”
