## Key Strategies Taught

### 1. Agency Targeting (5 Inputs Method)
- Certification(s)
- ZIP code / geographic presence
- PSC codes (what you do)
- NAICS codes (your industry)
- Target agencies (pick TOP 3, not 10)

### 2. Agency Pain Points (8 Major Pain Points)
1. Meeting small business goals (graded on this)
2. Finding specialized capabilities
3. Past performance verification
4. Geographic coverage requirements
5. Security clearance gaps
6. Quick-turn requirements
7. Budget uncertainty / continuing resolutions
8. Staffing turnover

**Key insight:** Don't sell services - solve problems

### 3. Sources Sought Secret
- Less than 5% of contractors respond to Sources Sought notices
- Responding puts you in top 5%
- You can influence how agencies write requirements

### 4. Expiring Contracts Strategy
- Fastest path to contracts
- Position 12-18 months before expiration
- Path A: Team WITH incumbent (lower risk, build past performance)
- Path B: Compete AGAINST incumbent (higher risk, higher reward)
- Contact both incumbent AND contracting officer

### 5. Hit List Method
- Filter opportunities by YOUR NAICS codes
- Cross-reference with target agencies
- Score by competition level (fewer bidders = better odds)
- Formula: Low competition + Right NAICS + Target Agency = High probability win
