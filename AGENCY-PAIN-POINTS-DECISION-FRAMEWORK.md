# Agency Pain Points Decision Framework
## How to Use Agency Pain Points to Choose Your Target Agencies

**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Purpose:** Match your business capabilities to agency pain points for faster wins and better fit

---

## 🎯 The Core Principle

**Agency pain points = Your business opportunities**

When agencies have pain points, they need solutions. Small businesses that understand and address these pain points:
- ✅ Get faster responses (agency wants solutions)
- ✅ Face less competition (most contractors don't think this way)
- ✅ Build better relationships (you're solving real problems)
- ✅ Win more contracts (you're addressing needs, not just bidding)
