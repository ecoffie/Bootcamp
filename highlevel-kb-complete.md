# GENERAL OVERVIEW

## What is government contracting?
Government contracting is when federal, state, or local government agencies buy products and services from private businesses. The federal government alone spends over $700 billion every year buying from businesses like yours. A portion of that is specifically set aside for small businesses.

## What kinds of things does the government buy?
Almost everything. IT services, construction, office supplies, food services, consulting, marketing, janitorial services, security, training, healthcare services, transportation, and more. If there's a business that provides it, there's likely a government agency that buys it.

## Is government contracting only for big companies?
No, that's one of the biggest myths. The federal government is required by law to award at least 23% of contracts to small businesses. That's hundreds of billions of dollars. Many agencies have goals even higher than that, and there are special programs that give small businesses an advantage.

## How is this different from selling to regular customers?
There are key differences. The government has specific rules about how they buy—it's more formal. You need to be registered in certain systems before you can bid. Contracts are often larger and longer-term, meaning more stable revenue. And government agencies tend to be repeat buyers once you're in.

## Where do I start with government contracting?
Start with registration. You need to be registered in SAM.gov—the System for Award Management. It's free and required before you can do business with the federal government.

## Do I need a special license to sell to the government?
No special license required. But you need to complete certain registrations and maintain your business in good standing. Think of registration as getting your credentials verified so the government knows you're a legitimate business.

## Can I sell to multiple levels of government?
Yes. You can sell to federal agencies, state agencies, counties, cities, school districts, public universities, and more. Each level has its own registration requirements, but many small businesses work across multiple levels.

## How long does it take to get a government contract?
Most businesses see their first real opportunity within 6-12 months of getting properly set up. Some move faster, especially with set-asides or subcontracting. The key is being realistic—this is a marathon, not a sprint.

## Why does government contracting take so long?
The government moves deliberately because they're spending taxpayer money. They have rules for fairness. But once you're in the system with a track record, things move faster. Your first contract is the hardest—after that, past performance makes winning easier.

# MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS

## Is it true that government contracting is too complicated for small businesses?
No. It has a learning curve, but thousands of small businesses figure it out every year. The key is understanding the process step by step rather than trying everything at once.

## Do I need connections or lobbyists to win government contracts?
No. Most government contracts are awarded through open competition. Opportunities are publicly posted. Relationships can help, but the process is designed to be transparent and give everyone a fair shot.

## Does the government take forever to pay?
Actually, federal agencies are required by law to pay within 30 days for most contracts. Compared to some private sector clients, the government can be more reliable.

## Do I have to be the lowest bidder to win?
Not always. Many contracts are awarded based on "best value," meaning they consider quality, experience, past performance, and other factors—not just price.

## Do certifications guarantee contracts?
No. Certifications open doors but don't guarantee anything. Think of them as an advantage, not a golden ticket. You still need to find opportunities, submit strong proposals, and deliver quality work.

# ELIGIBILITY

## Who is eligible to sell to the federal government?
To sell to the federal government, your business needs to be a legal business entity, have a Tax ID number, be in good standing with no debarments, have a physical US address for most contracts, and be able to accept electronic payments.

## Can any type of business sell to the government?
Almost any type. Service businesses, product companies, manufacturers, distributors, consultants, construction companies, technology firms—the government buys from all of them.

## I just started my business. Can I pursue government contracts?
You can register right away, but winning contracts is harder without a track record. Many new businesses start by subcontracting—working under an established contractor to build experience.

## Does my business need to be a certain size?
For small business set-asides, yes. The definition of "small" varies by industry using SBA size standards. Some industries define small as under 500 employees; others use annual revenue thresholds ranging from $1 million to $47 million or more.

## I work from home. Is that a problem?
Not necessarily. Many government contractors work from home, especially in consulting, IT, and professional services. You need a legitimate business address for registration—a home address works for many businesses.

## What if I'm too big to be considered small?
You'd compete as a large business for unrestricted contracts. You could also pursue mentor-protégé arrangements or joint ventures with certified small businesses. But most businesses asking this actually qualify as small—the thresholds are higher than people expect.

---

# SIZE STANDARDS

## How is "small business" defined for government contracting?
The Small Business Administration sets size standards for every industry using NAICS codes. Depending on your industry, the threshold is either employee count (typically 100-1,500) or average annual revenue over 3-5 years (ranging from $1 million to $47 million or more).

## What's a NAICS code?
NAICS stands for North American Industry Classification System. It's a 6-digit code that identifies your business type. You might have multiple codes if you offer different services. The code determines your size standard and what opportunities you can bid on.

## How many NAICS codes should I have?
Include every code that honestly represents work you can do. Most businesses have 3-10 codes. Don't go overboard with codes you can't perform, but don't be too narrow or you'll miss opportunities.

## How do I find my NAICS codes?
The Census Bureau has a search tool, or Google "NAICS code" plus what you do. Look at what competitors use. You can also describe your services during a consultation and we'll help identify the right codes.

## Can I add NAICS codes later?
Yes. You can update your SAM profile anytime to add or remove NAICS codes.

---

# READINESS

## What are signs I'm ready for government contracting?
You're likely ready if you've been in business 1-2 years, have a track record of delivering similar work, can handle cash flow (government pays after work is done), have required insurance, have capacity for additional work, have organized financials, and can dedicate time to the pursuit process.

## How much money do I need to get started?
Registration is free. The real costs are time and potentially professional help. You should have enough working capital to deliver on a contract before getting paid—typically 30-60 days of expenses. Some contracts require bonds or specific insurance.

## Do I need past government experience to win contracts?
Not always. You can use commercial past performance—work for private sector clients—to show you can deliver. Some contracts are set aside for businesses without government experience. Subcontracting is another way to build past performance first.

## When should I NOT pursue government contracting yet?
Government contracting might not be right yet if your business is less than 6 months old, you're having cash flow problems, you lack proper documentation, you can't clearly describe your services, you're looking for quick money, or your current workload leaves no capacity.

# SAM.GOV REGISTRATION

## What is SAM.gov?
SAM.gov is the System for Award Management—the official government database of businesses eligible for federal contracts. If you're not in SAM, you can't get paid on a federal contract. It's free to register and requires annual renewal.

## Is SAM.gov registration really free?
Yes, 100% free. If anyone charges you for SAM registration, that's a red flag. What's not free is your time—registration takes several hours and requires gathering information. Some businesses hire help for the complexity, not because there's a fee.

## How long does SAM registration take?
With all documents ready and no errors, it can be approved in 7-10 business days. But most people hit snags—wrong addresses, mismatched information, missing documentation. Realistic timeline is 2-4 weeks.

## What do I need to register in SAM.gov?
You'll need: legal business name and address, Tax ID (EIN or SSN), banking information for electronic payments, NAICS codes, product/service codes, size status information, and company officers/ownership information.

## What causes delays in SAM registration?
Common issues: business name doesn't exactly match IRS records, address mismatches between databases, missing or incorrect banking information, not having a UEI before starting, incomplete NAICS codes, and errors in company structure section.

## What if my SAM registration is rejected?
You'll get a notice explaining why. Common reasons include entity validation failures, IRS matching problems, or missing information. You can fix issues and resubmit. The Federal Service Desk can help if you're stuck.

## Do I need to renew SAM.gov?
Yes, every year. If you let it lapse, you can't receive contract payments until renewed. Set a calendar reminder 60 days before expiration.

## My SAM registration has been pending for weeks. What should I do?
Log in and check for error messages or information requests. If stuck in validation, contact the Federal Service Desk. Common issues are IRS validation problems—if your business name doesn't match their records exactly, it gets flagged.

---

# UEI AND CAGE CODE

## What is a UEI?
The UEI is your Unique Entity Identifier—a 12-character ID for your business in the federal contracting system. It replaced the old DUNS number in 2022. Every business needs one for SAM.gov registration.

## How do I get a UEI?
You request it during the SAM.gov registration process. You can also get it before completing full registration by starting entity registration on SAM.gov. It's usually assigned within a few days, sometimes instantly.

## I have an old DUNS number. Does that still work?
DUNS numbers were replaced by UEI in April 2022. If you were registered before then, you were assigned a UEI automatically. If starting fresh, you'll get a UEI through SAM.gov—no DUNS needed.

## Is there a cost for the UEI?
No, the UEI is assigned through SAM.gov at no charge.

## What is a CAGE code?
The CAGE code is a 5-character Commercial and Government Entity Code used by the Department of Defense and NATO. It's assigned automatically when you complete SAM.gov registration.

## Do I need a CAGE code if I'm not doing defense work?
You'll get one anyway through SAM registration at no extra cost or steps. Even if focused on civilian agencies now, having it means you're ready if defense opportunities arise.

---

# STATE AND LOCAL REGISTRATION

## Does federal registration cover state and local governments?
No. Federal registration (SAM.gov) doesn't automatically register you with state or local governments. Each state has its own vendor registration system, and cities/counties may have separate ones.

## Do I need to register in every state?
Only states where you want to pursue opportunities. Start with your home state and neighboring states where you can realistically work. Some contracts require you to already be registered before bidding.

## Are state certifications different from federal certifications?
Yes. Federal certifications like 8(a) or SDVOSB are separate from state MBE or DBE programs. Some states recognize federal certifications; some don't. You may need both for state and local work.

## How do I find my state's vendor registration?
Search for "[Your State] vendor registration" or "[Your State] procurement portal." Most states have an online system with names like VendorLink, BidNet, or state-specific portals.

---

# CERTIFICATIONS OVERVIEW

## What do certifications do for my business?
Certifications give you an advantage when competing for government contracts. Certain contracts are "set aside"—meaning only certified businesses can bid. Instead of 50 competitors, you might have 10.

## Do certifications guarantee I'll win contracts?
No. Certifications open doors but don't do the work for you. You still need to find opportunities, submit competitive proposals, and deliver quality work. Don't chase certifications you don't qualify for.

## Can I have multiple certifications?
Yes. Many businesses stack certifications. A Black woman veteran in a HUBZone could potentially qualify for WOSB, 8(a), SDVOSB, and HUBZone. More certifications mean more set-aside opportunities.

## Should I get certified before I register?
No—you need SAM.gov registration first. Most certification programs require an active SAM registration.

## Will the SBA send me contracts after I'm certified?
No. SBA doesn't award contracts—agencies do. SBA provides certifications and support, but you're responsible for finding and pursuing opportunities.

---

# WOSB AND EDWOSB

## What is WOSB certification?
WOSB is Women-Owned Small Business certification. It's a federal program that sets aside contracts for women-owned businesses.

## What is EDWOSB certification?
EDWOSB is Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business. It has the same requirements as WOSB plus an economic threshold—personal net worth under $850,000, excluding primary residence and business ownership.

## What are the requirements for WOSB?
At least 51% owned and controlled by one or more women, women manage day-to-day operations and make long-term decisions, meets small business size standards, and is a for-profit entity.

## What's the difference between WOSB and EDWOSB?
WOSB is for any women-owned small business meeting ownership and control requirements. EDWOSB adds an economic threshold—net worth under $850,000, not counting your home and business share. EDWOSB accesses more set-aside opportunities.

## How do I get WOSB certified?
Two paths: self-certification through the SBA's online portal (free), or using an SBA-approved Third Party Certifier (has a fee but can be faster). Both require uploading documents showing ownership and control.

## How long does WOSB certification take?
Self-certification typically takes 2-4 weeks through SBA. Third-party certification can be 4-8 weeks. Having clean documentation—operating agreements, bylaws, tax returns—speeds things up.

---

# SDVOSB

## What is SDVOSB certification?
SDVOSB is Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business certification. There are significant set-aside opportunities, especially with the VA and other federal agencies.

## What are the requirements for SDVOSB?
At least 51% owned by service-disabled veterans, a service-disabled veteran controls management and daily operations, the veteran holds the highest officer position (or can explain why not), and meets small business size standards.

## What counts as "service-disabled" for SDVOSB?
A disability incurred or aggravated during active duty in the armed forces. This needs documentation—typically a VA disability rating of any percentage, or DOD documentation.

## Where do I get SDVOSB certified?
Through the SBA's Veteran Small Business Certification program. The VA used to handle this but it moved to SBA. You'll upload military documentation, disability documentation, and business ownership documents.

## How long does SDVOSB certification take?
Typically 4-8 weeks through SBA. Having all documents in order speeds things up. Common delays come from incomplete military records or unclear ownership documentation.

---

# 8(a) PROGRAM

## What is the 8(a) program?
The 8(a) Business Development Program is SBA's premier certification for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. It's a 9-year program providing access to sole-source contracts, set-asides, mentoring, and business development assistance.

## Why is 8(a) considered powerful?
8(a) opens doors to contracts that can be awarded directly to you without competition—called sole-source awards up to $4.5 million for services or $7 million for manufacturing. It's harder to get but offers serious benefits.

## What are the requirements for 8(a) certification?
Owned (at least 51%) and controlled by U.S. citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged, owner demonstrates social disadvantage, owner demonstrates economic disadvantage (net worth under $850,000), business operational for at least 2 years (can be waived), shows potential for success, and owner is of good character.

## Who qualifies as socially disadvantaged for 8(a)?
SBA presumes social disadvantage for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans. Others can qualify by demonstrating they've experienced bias or chronic prejudice, including women of any race with additional documentation.

## How long does 8(a) certification take?
Typically 3-6 months. It's the most involved application—expect extensive documentation of personal finances, business history, tax returns, and often a personal narrative. Many businesses get help because requirements are complex.

## What happens during the 9 years of 8(a)?
Years 1-4 are the developmental stage with maximum support. Years 5-9 are the transitional stage where you become more self-sufficient. You can only be in the program once, so timing matters.

## Is 8(a) worth the effort?
For many businesses, yes. Sole-source contracts without competition are powerful. But you need to actively pursue opportunities—the certification alone doesn't bring contracts to you.

---

# HUBZONE

## What is HUBZone certification?
HUBZone certification is based on location. If your business and employees are in certain designated areas, you can access HUBZone set-asides. It directs government spending to economically challenged communities.

## What are the requirements for HUBZone?
Small business with principal office in a HUBZone, at least 35% of employees reside in HUBZones, and owned and controlled by U.S. citizens.

## How do I know if I'm in a HUBZone?
SBA has a HUBZone map tool online. Enter your address and it tells you immediately. Rural areas, urban empowerment zones, and Native American lands may qualify. Boundaries can change annually, so verify before applying.

## What if my area loses HUBZone designation after I'm certified?
Once certified, you get some protection. If your area loses designation, you typically have 3 years to maintain certification while transitioning or relocating. Check current rules as they can change.

## How long does HUBZone certification take?
Typically 2-4 months. You'll document your principal office location and employee residence information. SBA may do site visits.

---

# STATE CERTIFICATIONS

## What are MBE, WBE, and DBE certifications?
MBE (Minority Business Enterprise), WBE (Women's Business Enterprise), and DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) are state and local certification programs. They're separate from federal certifications and give access to state/local set-asides.

## Do federal certifications count at the state level?
Sometimes. Some states accept or expedite applications if you have federal certifications. Others require their own process regardless. Check with your specific state's certification office.

## Which state certifications should I get?
Start with your home state and states where you realistically want to work. Focus on certifications you actually qualify for that align with opportunities in your industry.

---

# WHICH CERTIFICATION FIRST

## Which certification should I pursue first?
Consider: which do you clearly qualify for, what level of government are you targeting, how competitive is your industry, what's your timeline, and what's your capacity. Don't chase certifications you'll fail to get.

## I'm a woman-owned business. Where should I start?
WOSB is often a good first step—it's straightforward and opens doors. If you also meet economic disadvantage thresholds, consider EDWOSB for more opportunities.

## I'm a veteran. What certification should I pursue?
If you have a service-connected disability, SDVOSB is powerful with significant set-asides. Start there if you qualify.

## Should I wait to pursue 8(a)?
Some businesses wait until more established to get maximum value from the 9-year window. Others want the benefits as early as possible. Consider your readiness to actively pursue opportunities when deciding timing.

---

# FINDING OPPORTUNITIES

## Where are federal contracts posted?
All federal contracts over $25,000 must be publicly posted on SAM.gov under Contract Opportunities. This is your primary source for federal opportunities.

## How do I find opportunities on SAM.gov?
Go to SAM.gov and look for Contract Opportunities. Search and filter by keywords, NAICS codes, set-aside type, agency, place of performance, and posted date. Save searches to get email alerts when new opportunities match.

## What about contracts under $25,000?
Smaller purchases—micro-purchases—don't have to be publicly posted. Agencies often use government credit cards or simplified procedures. Getting to know agency small business specialists helps you get on the radar for these.

## What's the difference between federal, state, and local opportunities?
Federal contracts are posted on SAM.gov, larger on average, more formal, nationwide. State contracts are on state-specific portals, vary in formality, regional. Local contracts are most fragmented with thousands of systems, often smaller but less competition.

## Should I focus on federal, state, or local contracting?
It depends on your business. Federal offers the biggest market if you can work anywhere. Local has less competition and easier relationship-building. Many successful contractors do both.

---

# WHY BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO FIND CONTRACTS

## Why can't I find government contracts?
Common reasons: not looking in the right places, using wrong keywords (government terminology differs from private sector), not checking regularly (opportunities have deadlines), searching too narrowly, or expecting opportunities to find you.

## I've been registered for months with no contracts. What's wrong?
Registration makes you visible—it doesn't bring contracts to you. You need to actively search for opportunities, respond to solicitations, and build relationships. The contracts go to businesses that pursue them.

## Why isn't registration enough?
SAM.gov registration is like having a phone number in a directory. People can find you if they look, but they won't look unless you give them a reason. You need to actively market, bid, and build relationships.

---

# BIDDING AND PROPOSALS

## How does bidding on government contracts work?
When you find an opportunity, you submit a bid (for commodity purchases where price is the main factor) or proposal (for services where they evaluate qualifications, approach, and price). The government evaluates responses and awards to the winner.

## How complicated are government proposals?
It varies widely. A simple purchase might need just a price quote. A large services contract might need 100+ pages with technical approach, past performance references, staffing plans, and detailed pricing. Start with smaller, simpler opportunities to learn.

## What makes a winning proposal?
The best proposals clearly demonstrate you understand what the agency needs, show relevant experience and capability, offer competitive pricing, and comply with all requirements. Many businesses miss basic requirements or don't communicate qualifications effectively.

---

# MULTIPLE BUSINESS IDEAS

## I have multiple business ideas. How do I know which one to pursue for government contracting?
Great question—and you're smart to think about this before diving in. The best approach is to let the data guide you. We have a free tool called Opportunity Hunter that shows you which agencies spend the most money in different industries. That way you can see where the real demand is before you commit to a direction.

## I have two businesses. Which one should I register for government contracting?
Rather than guessing, use our free Opportunity Hunter tool at {{OpportunityHunterLink}}. It shows you actual government spending by agency and industry. You might discover one of your businesses aligns with billions in annual spending while the other has limited opportunities. Let the numbers guide your decision.

## How do I decide which business idea has the best chance with government contracts?
Start with research, not assumptions. Our Opportunity Hunter tool is free and shows you which agencies are spending money and in what categories. You might think one idea is stronger, but the data could surprise you. It takes just a few minutes and could save you months of pursuing the wrong path.

## Can I register multiple businesses for government contracting?
Yes, you can register each business separately in SAM.gov. But if you're just starting out, I'd recommend focusing on one first. Use our free Opportunity Hunter tool to see which business aligns with the most government spending, then build your foundation there before expanding.

## What's the Opportunity Hunter tool?
Opportunity Hunter is a free tool we offer that lets you research government spending by agency and industry. It shows you where the money actually flows—so instead of guessing whether there's demand for your services, you can see real numbers. It's the first step we recommend for anyone trying to decide which direction to take.

## How does Opportunity Hunter work?
You enter your industry or service type, and it shows you which federal agencies spend money in that area and how much. You can compare different industries side by side. It's completely free and takes just a few minutes. Think of it as market research for government contracting.

## Where can I access Opportunity Hunter?
You can access it for free at {{OpportunityHunterLink}}. No registration required—just start exploring spending data right away.

## Is it better to be a generalist or specialist in government contracting?
Generally, specialists win more. Agencies want to hire experts, not jacks-of-all-trades. But which specialty? Use Opportunity Hunter to find niches with strong spending. A specialized business in a high-demand area beats a generalist trying to do everything.

# ERIC COFFIE'S 5-PHASE ACTION PLAN

## What's the recommended process for getting into government contracting?
Eric Coffie recommends a 5-phase approach: Phase 1 is Setup (do once), Phase 2 is Bidding (repeat), Phase 3 is Business Development (repeat), Phase 4 is Business Enhancement (do once), and Phase 5 is Contract Management. Most beginners should focus on completing Phase 1 before moving on.

## What is Phase 1 - Setup?
Phase 1 is your foundation—you do this once to get properly registered and positioned. The steps are: 1) Choose your business structure (supplier vs. service provider vs. consultant), 2) Get your UEI number, 3) Create a professional email, 4) Identify your NAICS codes, 5) Create your SAM.gov profile, 6) Register for local government sites, 7) Talk to your local APEX Accelerator, 8) Create or fix your capability statement.

## How do I choose my business structure?
Decide if you're a supplier (selling products), service provider (delivering services like IT, janitorial, security), or consultant (providing expertise and advice). This affects your NAICS codes, the opportunities you pursue, and how you position yourself. Each has different requirements and contract types.

## What's a UEI and how do I get one?
UEI stands for Unique Entity Identifier. It replaced the old DUNS number. You get it free through SAM.gov when you start your registration. It's required before you can complete your SAM profile.

## Why do I need a professional email?
A professional email (yourname@yourbusiness.com) looks more credible than a Gmail or Yahoo address when dealing with government buyers. It signals you're a legitimate business, not a hobby.

## How do I identify my NAICS codes?
NAICS codes classify what type of work you do. Search the Census Bureau's NAICS lookup tool or Google your service type plus "NAICS code." Most businesses have 3-10 codes. Pick codes that honestly represent work you can perform—don't overreach, but don't be too narrow either.

## How do I create a SAM.gov profile?
Go to SAM.gov and start the entity registration process. You'll need your UEI, business information, banking details, NAICS codes, and company officer information. Take your time—errors cause delays. The process takes 2-4 weeks if done correctly.

## What's DSBS?
DSBS is the Dynamic Small Business Search—a database within SAM.gov where contracting officers search for small businesses. Once your SAM registration is complete, your business appears in DSBS. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling.

## What's an APEX Accelerator?
APEX Accelerators (formerly called PTACs) are free government-funded counseling centers that help small businesses with government contracting. They provide free one-on-one counseling, training, and assistance with registration and certifications. Every state has them—find your local one and schedule a meeting.

## What should I say to my APEX Accelerator counselor?
Tell them: what your business does, that you're interested in government contracting, where you are in the process (registered or not), and what help you need. They can review your SAM profile, help with your capability statement, point you to opportunities, and guide your certification strategy. It's free—use them.

## What's a capability statement?
A capability statement is your business resume—a one or two-page document that tells government buyers who you are, what you do, your past performance, differentiators, certifications, and contact information. You need one before meeting with buyers or attending events. Make sure it clearly shows what makes you different from competitors.

## What should be on my capability statement?
Include: company name and logo, core competencies (what you do), differentiators (what makes you unique), past performance (relevant work you've done), NAICS codes, certifications and set-asides, UEI and CAGE code, and contact information. Keep it clean, professional, and focused on what buyers care about.

## What is Phase 2 - Bidding?
Phase 2 is where you actually pursue opportunities. This is a repeating cycle: 1) Review immediate bid opportunities, 2) Assemble your team based on the opportunity, 3) Apply for vendor/supplier credit if needed, 4) Respond to the opportunity (RFP, RFQ, RFI, or Task Order), 5) Evaluate your bid results and learn from wins and losses.

## How do I find bid opportunities?
Search SAM.gov Contract Opportunities filtered by your NAICS codes and set-asides. But remember—SAM.gov only shows about 5% of opportunities. Use Opportunity Hunter to find which agencies spend in your space, then dig into IDIQ task orders, GSA schedules, and agency-specific portals for the other 95%.

## What's the difference between RFP, RFQ, and RFI?
RFP (Request for Proposal) asks for a detailed proposal including technical approach and pricing—used for complex services. RFQ (Request for Quotation) asks for pricing on specific items—used for simpler purchases. RFI (Request for Information) is the government gathering info before an actual solicitation—respond to these to get on their radar.

## Should I bid on everything I find?
No. Use a bid/no-bid framework to qualify opportunities. Consider: Do you meet all requirements? Do you have relevant past performance? Can you compete on price? Do you have or can you assemble the right team? Is the timeline realistic? Bidding on everything wastes resources and produces weak proposals.

## What is Phase 3 - Business Development?
Phase 3 is proactive relationship building and opportunity hunting—not just waiting for things to appear on SAM.gov. Steps: 1) Identify your top 25 buyers and future bids, 2) Set up and attend meetings with government buyers, 3) Attend industry events, 4) Attend site visits, 5) Get on supplier lists for top 25 federal prime contractors, 6) Monitor contract awards and identify subcontracting opportunities, 7) Track long-term IDIQ contracts to bid on.

## What do you mean by "Top 25 Buyers"?
These are the 25 agencies, offices, or prime contractors most likely to buy what you sell. Use Opportunity Hunter and spending data to identify who's actually spending money in your NAICS codes. Then focus your business development on building relationships with those specific buyers rather than spraying and praying.

## Why are industry events important?
Industry events let you meet contracting officers, prime contractors, and potential teaming partners face-to-face. Many contracts are influenced by relationships built before the solicitation drops. Events include agency industry days, small business conferences, and matchmaking sessions.

## What's a site visit?
Some agencies hold site visits where potential contractors can see the work location and ask questions before bidding. Attending shows you're serious and gives you information competitors who skip it won't have.

## How do I get on prime contractor supplier lists?
Contact the Small Business Liaison Officers (SBLOs) at large prime contractors. Tell them your capabilities, certifications, and NAICS codes. Primes need small business subcontractors to meet their contractual goals—position yourself as a solution to their problem.

## What is Phase 4 - Business Enhancement?
Phase 4 is about leveling up once you have your foundation and some experience. Steps: 1) Apply for small business certifications, 2) Pursue 8(a) certification if eligible, 3) Explore Mentor-Protégé programs, 4) Focus on self-performance capability as a differentiator, 5) Find better partners, 6) Identify a mid-size mentor, 7) Speak at an event to build credibility.

## When should I pursue certifications?
After you have Phase 1 complete and ideally some bidding experience from Phase 2. Certifications open doors to set-asides, but they don't help if you don't have the foundation to compete. Don't chase certifications before you're ready to use them.

## What's a Mentor-Protégé program?
Mentor-Protégé programs pair small businesses with larger, experienced contractors who provide guidance, training, and sometimes joint venture opportunities. SBA has a federal program; many agencies and primes have their own. It's a way to build capability and access larger contracts.

## Why focus on self-performance capability?
As you grow, being able to self-perform work (rather than subbing everything out) becomes a competitive advantage. Agencies increasingly want to see that you can actually do the work, not just manage subcontractors. Build real capability over time.

## Why should I speak at an event?
Speaking positions you as an expert, builds credibility, and creates visibility with potential buyers and partners. It's business development that scales—one presentation reaches many people.

## What is Phase 5 - Contract Management?
Phase 5 kicks in after you win contracts. It's about delivering successfully and staying compliant. Steps: 1) Complete system registrations (PIEE, WAWF), 2) Manage subcontractor compliance, 3) Handle project compliance, 4) Maintain communication with the contracting officer.

## What's PIEE?
PIEE (Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment) is the DoD system for contract administration. If you win a DoD contract, you'll need to register and use PIEE for various administrative functions.

## What's WAWF?
WAWF (Wide Area Workflow) is how you submit invoices for payment on many government contracts, especially DoD. You must be registered and know how to use it to get paid.

## Why is communication important in contract management?
Proactive communication with your contracting officer prevents small issues from becoming big problems. Report progress, flag issues early, and document everything. A well-managed contract leads to strong past performance ratings, which help you win future contracts.

## Which phase should I start with?
Start with Phase 1 - Setup. Don't skip ahead. Many people try to jump straight to bidding without having their foundation in place, and they waste time on opportunities they're not positioned to win. Complete Phase 1 first, then cycle through Phase 2 (Bidding) and Phase 3 (Business Development) repeatedly as you grow.

## How long does Phase 1 take?
If you focus, you can complete Phase 1 in 30-60 days. SAM.gov registration takes 2-4 weeks. Creating your capability statement takes a few days. Scheduling an APEX meeting takes a week or two. The key is not to get stuck—keep moving through the steps.

## Can I do Phase 2 and Phase 3 at the same time?
Yes, and you should. Bidding (Phase 2) and Business Development (Phase 3) work together. While you're responding to immediate opportunities, you're also building relationships for future opportunities. Most successful contractors run both continuously.

# RESULTS AND PRICING

## What results can I expect?
Within 90 days, clients are typically fully registered in SAM.gov, clear on certifications to pursue, equipped with target opportunities, and actively bidding. Within 6-12 months, many have their first contract or subcontract.

## What don't you promise?
We don't promise specific contract values or guarantee wins. Anyone who guarantees that isn't being honest. We guarantee you'll be properly set up and equipped to compete.

## How is pricing structured?
Pricing depends on services needed: registration assistance is a flat fee, certification support is per-certification, opportunity identification can be monthly or project-based, and proposal support varies by complexity. Comprehensive packages offer bundled rates.

# BUYER PSYCHOLOGY - UNDERSTANDING THEIR WHY

## Why understand buyer psychology first?
Before recommending any solution, understand WHY they want government contracting. Their psychological state determines how we position our offer.

## The 5 Buyer Psychology Types

### Type 1: Rock Bottom Buyer
**Indicators:** "I just got laid off," "My business failed," "I need to make a change," "starting over"
**What they're buying:** A new identity. Escape from who they were.
**Response:** "A lot of our most successful clients came to government contracting after a major life change. When everything falls apart, it's the perfect time to build something new."

### Type 2: Almost There Buyer
**Indicators:** "I've taken other courses," "I know the basics," "What's actually working?" Already registered but no wins.
**What they're buying:** The missing piece that finally makes it click.
**Response:** "You've put in the work—you're not starting from zero. You need the specific strategy that's actually working right now, not more generic information."

### Type 3: Identity Buyer
**Indicators:** Excited about community, asks who else is involved, wants to be "in the room," talks about what they're "working on"
**What they're buying:** The label. Being "a government contractor."
**Response:** "You'd be joining a community of serious business owners actively winning contracts. You're not just learning—you're becoming someone who operates at a different level."

### Type 4: Escape Buyer
**Indicators:** "I hate my job," "I want to be my own boss," "I want freedom," comments about hating Mondays
**What they're buying:** The fantasy of a different life. Freedom.
**Response:** "Government contracting can be your exit strategy. Imagine picking your own projects, working with agencies you respect, building something that's yours."

### Type 5: Revenge Buyer
**Indicators:** "Everyone told me this wouldn't work," "I want to show them," "People doubted me"
**What they're buying:** Proof. The ability to say "I told you so."
**Response:** "I love that energy. When you land that first contract, those people who doubted you won't have shit to say. Let's make that happen."

## Questions to Uncover Buyer Psychology
- "What made you start looking into government contracting?"
- "What's going on in your life right now that brought you here?"
- "Why government contracting? Why now?"
- "What would winning a government contract mean for you?"
- "What happens if you don't figure this out?"
- "Who would be most surprised if you succeeded at this?"

## Listen for emotional triggers:
- **Rock Bottom:** Pain, loss, desperation, starting over
- **Almost There:** Frustration, "I've tried everything," seeking missing piece
- **Identity:** Belonging, community, being seen, labels
- **Escape:** Freedom, hatred of current situation
- **Revenge:** Proving people wrong, doubt from others

# 4-BUCKET PROSPECT ASSESSMENT

## How do you determine what help I need?
We use a simple framework based on where you are in your government contracting journey. There are basically four stages: people just getting started who need direction, people registered but unsure what industry to focus on, people registered but not winning contracts, and people who've won but want consistent growth. Each stage needs different support.

## Assessment: Bucket 1 - New and Need Direction
**Profile:** Knows about government contracting and anxious to get started but doesn't know where—state, local, federal, or what certifications to pursue.

**Key indicators:**
- "I keep hearing about government contracting but don't know where to start"
- "Should I do federal or start with local?"
- "What certifications do I need?"
- "I've been watching YouTube videos but I'm confused"

**Recommended solution:** Free Course, Group Coaching, or strategy call for clarity.

## Assessment: Bucket 2 - Registered but Unsure What Industry
**Profile:** Registered in SAM but not sure what industry to pick. Wants low-hanging fruit. May not have an established business yet.

**Key indicators:**
- "I'm registered but don't know what to sell"
- "What's the easiest thing to get started with?"
- "What industry has the most opportunity?"

**Qualifying questions:**
- Who in your network has a business?
- Do you want the financial responsibility of managing a business?
- Are you better at paperwork or doing the actual work?

**Recommended solution:** Opportunity Hunter (free), Bootcamp, Group Coaching Starter.

## Assessment: Bucket 3 - Registered but Not Winning
**Profile:** Registered in SAM, may have certifications, but not winning contracts. Frustrated, losing hope, needs encouragement.

**Key indicators:**
- "I have my SAM registration and certifications but nothing's happening"
- "I keep bidding but never win"
- "I'm frustrated and about to give up"

**Qualifying questions:**
- Are you using a bid/no-bid framework?
- Do you have a pipeline tracker?
- Are you tracking Task Order and IDIQ contracts (the 95% not on SAM)?

**Recommended solution:** Group Coaching Pro, Bootcamp, 1-on-1 Coaching.

## Assessment: Bucket 4 - Won but Need Consistent Growth
**Profile:** Won a few contracts but not consistent. Questions about growing, hiring, finding larger partners.

**Key indicators:**
- "I've won some contracts but it's inconsistent"
- "How do I grow from here?"
- "I want to go after bigger projects"

**Recommended solution:** 1-on-1 coaching or White Glove service.

## Quick Qualifying Questions
1. "Are you registered in SAM.gov?" (No = Bucket 1, Yes = continue)
2. "Have you won any government contracts?" (Yes = Bucket 4, No = continue)
3. "Do you know what you want to sell to the government?" (No = Bucket 2, Yes = Bucket 3)

## I'm registered in SAM.gov / I have my SAM registration
Great, that's an important first step done! Now let me ask you a couple quick questions to figure out exactly where you are and what you need next. Have you won any government contracts yet? And do you already know what products or services you want to sell to the government, or are you still figuring that out?

## Someone says they're registered in SAM - what's next?
When someone says they're registered in SAM, DO NOT immediately jump to NAICS codes. Instead, ask: 1) Have you won any contracts? 2) Do you know what you want to sell? Their answers determine which bucket they're in and what guidance they need.

# OBJECTION RESPONSES

## Response: "I can do this myself"
You absolutely can. The question is whether you want to spend time learning a new system or focus on what you do best while someone experienced handles the complexity. Most DIY attempts either succeed after significant time investment or hit frustrations that cost months. Even if you want to do most yourself, a strategy call can give you a roadmap.

## Response: "This sounds expensive"
What's your frame of reference? Registration itself is free. Where businesses spend money is professional help to avoid mistakes and save time. A registration error delays you weeks. Missing a certification opportunity costs you a set-aside contract. Think of it as investment in getting to revenue faster. Let's discuss what you actually need.

## Response: "I don't trust consultants"
I get it. Some people in this industry overpromise and underdeliver. Here's what I can tell you about {{BusinessName}}: we don't guarantee contracts because no one honestly can. We don't charge for free things. We're upfront about realistic timelines. Have a conversation with us, ask hard questions, talk to past clients. If something feels off, trust your gut.

## Response: "I don't want to waste time"
Neither do we. A strategy call takes 30 minutes. We'll assess whether government contracting is realistic for your business right now. If it's not, we'll tell you—there's no point wasting time on something that won't work. Some businesses aren't ready yet, and that's okay. But if there's a fit, we show you a direct path.

## Response: "Is this a scam?"
Fair question. There are scammers who prey on small businesses. Red flags: anyone guaranteeing contracts, charging for free things like SAM registration, pressuring immediate payment, or requesting sensitive information too early. We help with the process and charge reasonable fees for expertise. You can verify us. Government contracting itself is legitimate—hundreds of billions awarded annually.

## Response: "What if I don't win anything?"
That's a real concern. There are no guarantees—you can do everything right and not win. That's true in any competition. What we do is put you in the best position: properly registered, pursuing right opportunities, submitting competitive proposals, learning from losses. Most businesses don't win their first bid, but each attempt builds experience. This is a long-term strategy, not a one-shot gamble.

## Response: "I need to think about it"
Of course—take the time you need. While thinking, consider: government contracting rewards businesses that start early. Registration takes time, certifications take time, relationships take time. Businesses winning contracts this year started preparing last year. No pressure to decide today, but don't let "think about it" become "forget about it."

## Response: "I tried this before and it didn't work"
Tell me more about what happened. Common issues: registration got stuck, couldn't find fitting opportunities, bid but never won, got overwhelmed. These are all solvable. Sometimes it's approach—wrong places or opportunities. Sometimes it's needing guidance past sticking points. What happened before doesn't predict what happens next.

## Booking: When value is demonstrated
I'm glad this has been helpful. General information only goes so far—what moves the needle is a strategy specifically for your business.

---

# GETTING STARTED

## What happens after I sign up?
After sign-up: kickoff call to gather business information and goals, document collection, registration completion if needed, strategy development for certifications and opportunities, then active pursuit together.

## How much of my time will this take?
At minimum, you'll provide documents, make decisions about certifications and opportunities, and prepare proposals. Maybe 2-4 hours per week during active pursuit. We handle the heavy lifting, but you can't be completely hands-off.

## What documents do you need from me?
For registration: business formation documents, EIN verification, bank account information, tax returns, and company officer information. For certifications, requirements vary—we provide a specific checklist.

## What does the consultation include?
Our consultation is a 30-minute call where we understand your business, assess your registration and certification status, discuss your goals, identify potential opportunities and realistic timelines, recommend next steps, and answer your questions.

## What should I have ready for the call?
It helps to know how long you've been in business, what products or services you offer, whether you've done government work before, and whether you've started any registrations. But even if you're just curious, that's fine.

## How do I book a consultation?
You can book directly at {{ConsultationLink}} or call us at {{PhoneNumber}}. We'll assess your situation and create an action plan.
