## INTRO (5 minutes)

### Opening Hook
"What's up everyone! Welcome to the live. If you're just joining, drop where you're watching from in the chat. We had an INCREDIBLE bootcamp on Friday - 8 hours of pure GovCon strategy - and tonight I'm breaking down the biggest takeaways."

### Set Expectations
"Here's what we're doing tonight:
- I'm sharing the TOP strategies we covered
- Real frameworks you can use RIGHT NOW
- And I'll answer your questions live

If you weren't at the bootcamp, you're about to get a crash course. If you WERE there, this is your review session. Let's get it."

## SEGMENT 1: THE MARKET ASSASSIN METHOD (10 minutes)

### Key Talking Points:

**The Problem:**
"Most contractors spray and pray. They go after every opportunity. That's a losing strategy. The winners? They TARGET."

**The 5 Inputs That Change Everything:**
1. Your certification(s)
2. Your ZIP code / geographic presence
3. Your PSC codes (what you DO)
4. Your NAICS codes (your industry)
5. Target agencies (who you WANT to work with)

**The 8 Reports:**
"When you run Market Assassin with those 5 inputs, you get 8 reports:
- Market Analytics - where's the money flowing?
- Government Buyers - WHO is spending?
- Competition Analysis - who are you up against?
- Agency Forecast - what's coming down the pipeline?
- And 4 more..."

**Actionable Takeaway:**
"Here's what I want you to do: Pick your TOP 3 agencies. Not 10. Not 5. THREE. Focus beats everything."

---

## SEGMENT 2: AGENCY PAIN POINTS (8 minutes)

### Key Talking Points:

**The 2 Core Struggles Every Agency Has:**
1. Finding qualified small businesses
2. Matching capabilities to requirements

"Think about that. They NEED you. They're REQUIRED to spend money with small businesses. The problem? They can't find you."

**The 8 Major Pain Points:**
1. Meeting small business goals (they get graded on this!)
2. Finding specialized capabilities
3. Past performance verification
4. Geographic coverage requirements
5. Security clearance gaps
6. Quick-turn requirements
7. Budget uncertainty / continuing resolutions
8. Staffing turnover (new COs don't know vendors)

**Actionable Takeaway:**
"Position yourself as the SOLUTION to their pain. Don't sell services - solve problems. Your capability statement should speak to THEIR challenges, not YOUR features."

---

## SEGMENT 3: AI PROMPTS THAT WORK (8 minutes)

### Key Talking Points:

**Why AI Matters in GovCon:**
"I gave everyone 75 AI prompts. But here's the thing - it's not about the prompts. It's about SPEED. The contractor who researches faster, responds faster, and positions faster... wins."

**Top 3 Prompt Categories:**

1. **Agency Research Prompts:**
   - "Analyze this agency's small business spending for the last 3 years"
   - "What are the top contractors winning at [Agency]?"

2. **Outreach Prompts:**
   - "Write a capability introduction email to a contracting officer at [Agency] for [Service]"
   - "Draft a teaming inquiry to [Prime Contractor]"

3. **Proposal Prompts:**
   - "Review this RFP section and identify the evaluation criteria"
   - "Draft a past performance narrative for [Project]"

**Actionable Takeaway:**
"Start using AI for research TODAY. Before you reach out to ANY agency, run an AI research prompt. Know their spending. Know their primes. Know their pain points."

---

## SEGMENT 4: THE HIT LIST METHOD (10 minutes)

### Key Talking Points:

**What is the Hit List?**
"The Hit List is a curated list of opportunities MATCHED to your capabilities. Not random SAM.gov results. MATCHED."

**The 3-Step Process:**
1. Filter by your NAICS codes
2. Cross-reference with target agencies
3. Score by competition level (fewer bidders = better odds)

**Where to Find Low-Competition Opportunities:**
- Sources Sought notices (most contractors ignore these!)
- RFI responses (shape the requirement before it drops)
- Expiring contracts (position before recompete)

**The Sources Sought Secret:**
"Less than 5% of contractors respond to Sources Sought notices. That means if you respond, you're already in the top 5%. AND you can influence how the agency writes the requirement."

**Actionable Takeaway:**
"This week, find ONE Sources Sought notice in your NAICS. Respond to it. That's it. One response puts you ahead of 95% of your competition."

---

## SEGMENT 5: EXPIRING CONTRACTS STRATEGY (8 minutes)

### Key Talking Points:

**Why Expiring Contracts?**
"The fastest path to a contract isn't chasing new opportunities. It's positioning on contracts that are about to recompete."

**Who to Contact:**
- **The Incumbent** - They might need a small business sub
- **The Contracting Officer** - Express interest in the recompete
- **Both** - Different strategies, same opportunity

**The Timing:**
"12-18 months before expiration is the sweet spot. That's when:
- Agencies start market research
- Incumbents start thinking about teaming
- You can actually influence the outcome"

**The Two Paths:**
1. **Team WITH the incumbent** - Be their small business partner
2. **Compete AGAINST the incumbent** - Position as the better option

**Actionable Takeaway:**
"Go to USASpending.gov. Find 3 contracts in your NAICS expiring in the next 18 months. Add them to your pipeline. That's your hit list."

---

## Q&A SEGMENT (10-15 minutes)

### Prompt Questions (if chat is slow):
- "Anyone here already registered on SAM.gov?"
- "What's your primary NAICS code? Drop it in chat."
- "Who's been to an agency matchmaking event?"
- "What's your biggest challenge right now - finding opportunities or winning them?"

### Common Questions to Prepare For:

**"How do I find contracting officers?"**
"FPDS, USASpending, agency OSDBU offices, and our Government Buyers report in Market Assassin."

**"Do I need past performance to win?"**
"Not for micro-purchases under $10K. For larger contracts, commercial past performance counts. Start small, build up."

**"How do I team with primes?"**
"Don't ask to team. Bring VALUE. Know what contracts they have. Know where they need small business support. Make it easy for them to say yes."

**"Is 8(a) certification worth it?"**
"If you're eligible, absolutely. Sole-source up to $4.5M for services, $7M for manufacturing. That's game-changing."

One action. That's all it takes to start building momentum."
