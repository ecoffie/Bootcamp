# BASICS

## What is government contracting?
Government agencies buy products and services from private businesses. The federal government spends over $700 billion yearly—at least 23% goes to small businesses.

## What does the government buy?
Almost everything: IT, construction, consulting, janitorial, security, healthcare, food services, marketing, training, and more.

## Where do I start?
Register in SAM.gov (free, required). Then identify your NAICS codes, talk to your local APEX Accelerator, and create a capability statement.

## How long to get a contract?
6-12 months typically. Registration takes 2-4 weeks. First contract is hardest—after that, past performance helps you win more.

## Do I need certifications?
Not required, but they help. Certifications give access to set-aside contracts with less competition.

---

# REGISTRATION

## What is SAM.gov?
The official federal database. You must be registered to get paid on federal contracts. Free to register, renew annually.

## What do I need for SAM?
Business name, Tax ID (EIN), banking info, NAICS codes, company officer info. Name must match IRS records exactly.

## What's a UEI?
Unique Entity Identifier—your 12-character business ID. Replaced DUNS in 2022. Get it free through SAM.gov.

## What's a CAGE code?
5-character code for DoD/NATO. Assigned automatically with SAM registration.

## What causes SAM delays?
Name mismatches with IRS, address issues, missing banking info, incomplete NAICS codes.

---

# NAICS & SIZE

## What's a NAICS code?
6-digit industry classification. Determines your size standard and which opportunities you can bid on. Most businesses have 3-10 codes.

## How is "small business" defined?
Varies by NAICS code—either employee count (100-1,500) or annual revenue ($1M-$47M+). Check SBA size standards.

# CERTIFICATIONS

## WOSB (Women-Owned Small Business)
51%+ owned/controlled by women. Self-certify through SBA (free) or use third-party certifier. Takes 2-4 weeks.

## EDWOSB (Economically Disadvantaged WOSB)
Same as WOSB plus net worth under $850K (excluding home/business). More set-asides available.

## SDVOSB (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned)
51%+ owned by service-disabled veterans. Certify through SBA. Takes 4-8 weeks.

## 8(a) Program
SBA's premier certification for socially/economically disadvantaged owners. 9-year program with sole-source contracts up to $4.5M (services) or $7M (manufacturing). Takes 3-6 months.

## HUBZone
Based on location—principal office in HUBZone, 35%+ employees live in HUBZones. Takes 2-4 months.

## Do certifications guarantee contracts?
No. They open doors but you still must find opportunities, bid competitively, and deliver.

---

# FINDING OPPORTUNITIES

## Where are contracts posted?
Federal: SAM.gov Contract Opportunities. But only ~5% are there—95% are task orders under IDIQs not publicly posted.

## Why can't I find contracts?
Wrong keywords, not checking regularly, searching too narrowly, or expecting opportunities to find you. Use Opportunity Hunter to see where agencies spend.

## What's the difference between RFP, RFQ, RFI?
RFP = detailed proposal for complex services. RFQ = price quote for specific items. RFI = government gathering info before solicitation—respond to get on their radar.

# OBJECTIONS

## "I can do this myself"
You can. Question is time vs. expertise. Most DIY attempts either succeed after months or hit costly frustrations. A strategy call gives you a roadmap either way.

## "This sounds expensive"
Registration is free. Investment is in avoiding mistakes and saving time. One registration error = weeks of delay. One missed certification = lost set-aside contracts.

## "I don't trust consultants"
Fair. Red flags: guaranteeing contracts, charging for free things, pressure tactics. We don't guarantee contracts—no one honestly can. Ask us hard questions.

## "What if I don't win?"
No guarantees in competition. We put you in best position: proper registration, right opportunities, competitive proposals. Most don't win first bid—each attempt builds experience.

## "Is this a scam?"
Government contracting is real—$700B+ annually. Scam red flags: guaranteed contracts, charging for SAM registration, pressure for immediate payment.
