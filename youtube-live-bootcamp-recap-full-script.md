## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**"January Bootcamp RECAP - 8 Hours of GovCon Strategy in 45 Minutes"**

### Talking Points:
- *Don't stay on this slide long - 10-15 seconds max*
- "Alright, January Bootcamp Recap. Let's go."
- Transition: "Let me show you what we covered..."

---

## SLIDE 2: What We Covered at the Bootcamp
**Stats: 8 Hours | 7 Sessions | 75 AI Prompts | 8 Deliverables**

### Talking Points:
> "Look at these numbers. 8 hours of live training. 7 core sessions. We gave out 75 AI prompts - prompts you can use TODAY to research agencies, write outreach emails, and build proposals faster.
>
> And 8 deliverables - actual tools and templates people walked away with.
>
> But here's the thing - I can't cover 8 hours in one live. So tonight, I'm giving you the TOP 5 strategies. The ones that will move the needle the fastest.
>
> If you take just ONE of these and actually execute on it this week? You'll be ahead of 90% of contractors out there."

**Transition:** "Let's start with Strategy #1 - and this one changes EVERYTHING about how you approach federal contracting..."

---

## SLIDE 3: Strategy #1 - Target Like a Sniper
**"Stop spraying and praying. Start TARGETING."**

### Talking Points:
> "Strategy number one: Target like a sniper.
>
> Here's what I see all the time - contractors going after EVERY opportunity. They're on SAM.gov every day, applying to everything that looks remotely related to what they do.
>
> That's a LOSING strategy. You're competing against everybody. You're spreading yourself thin. And you're probably losing more than you're winning.
>
> The contractors who are actually winning contracts? They TARGET. They pick their agencies. They pick their opportunities. They focus.
>
> I'm about to show you exactly how they do it."

**Transition:** "It all comes down to 5 inputs..."

---

## SLIDE 4: The 5 Inputs That Change Everything

### Talking Points:
> "Write these down. I'm serious - pause what you're doing and write these down.
>
> **Number 1: Your certifications.** 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone - whatever you have. This determines which set-asides you can compete for.
>
> **Number 2: Your ZIP code.** Where are you located? Some agencies have local preference. Some contracts require geographic presence.
>
> **Number 3: Your PSC codes.** Product and Service Codes. This is WHAT you do. If you don't know your PSCs, that's homework for tonight.
>
> **Number 4: Your NAICS codes.** Your industry classification. This is how agencies categorize the work.
>
> **Number 5: Your target agencies.** Not every agency. Not 10 agencies. Your TOP 3.
>
> Here's the action step: Write these 5 things down RIGHT NOW. This is your targeting foundation. Everything else builds on this."

**Transition:** "Now once you know your targets, you need to understand what they're struggling with..."

---

## SLIDE 5: Strategy #2 - Agency Pain Points
**8 Pain Points Grid**

### Talking Points:
> "Strategy #2: Understand agency pain points.
>
> Look at this list. These are the 8 things keeping contracting officers up at night:
>
> 1. **Meeting small business goals** - They get GRADED on this. If they don't hit their numbers, it looks bad on their performance review.
>
> 2. **Finding specialized capabilities** - They need very specific things and can't always find vendors who do it.
>
> 3. **Past performance verification** - They need to justify why they're picking you.
>
> 4. **Geographic coverage** - Can you actually serve where they need you?
>
> 5. **Security clearances** - This is a big one for DoD work.
>
> 6. **Quick-turn requirements** - Sometimes they need it FAST and their usual contractors can't deliver.
>
> 7. **Budget uncertainty** - CRs, shutdowns, they never know what money they'll have.
>
> 8. **Staffing turnover** - New COs come in and don't know who the good vendors are.
>
> Here's what this means for YOU: They NEED you. They're REQUIRED to spend with small businesses. The problem isn't that they don't want to work with you - it's that they can't FIND you."

**Transition:** "So how do you position yourself? That brings us to the most important mindset shift..."

---

## SLIDE 6: Don't Sell Services. Solve Problems.

### Talking Points:
> "Read this slide. Let it sink in.
>
> Don't sell services. Solve problems.
>
> Most capability statements I see? They're all about the contractor. 'We do this, we do that, we've been in business for 20 years...'
>
> Nobody cares.
>
> What agencies care about is: Can you solve their problem?
>
> Your capability statement should speak to THEIR challenges, not YOUR features.
>
> Instead of 'We provide IT services' - try 'We help agencies meet their small business IT spending goals while maintaining security compliance.'
>
> See the difference? One is about you. One is about THEM."

**Transition:** "Now, let's talk about how AI is changing the game for contractors who know how to use it..."

---

## SLIDE 7: Strategy #3 - AI for Speed
**75 Ready-to-Use Prompts**

### Talking Points:
> "Strategy #3: Use AI for speed.
>
> At the bootcamp, I gave everyone 75 AI prompts. But here's the real lesson - it's not about the prompts. It's about SPEED.
>
> The contractor who researches faster, responds faster, positions faster... WINS.
>
> Let me give you three examples:
>
> **Agency Research:** Before you reach out to ANY agency, you should know their spending patterns, their pain points, who their top contractors are. AI can do that research in 5 minutes that used to take you a full day.
>
> **Outreach Emails:** Writing a capability introduction email used to take an hour to get right. Now you can generate a solid draft in 30 seconds and customize it.
>
> **Proposal Writing:** AI can review an RFP and identify the evaluation criteria, the hot buttons, what the agency is really looking for. That's intelligence that wins contracts.
>
> The contractors who are using AI right now have a MASSIVE advantage. Don't get left behind."

**Transition:** "Alright, Strategy #4 - this is where we talk about finding the RIGHT opportunities..."

---

## SLIDE 8: Strategy #4 - The Hit List Method

### Talking Points:
> "Strategy #4: The Hit List Method.
>
> Stop scrolling through random SAM.gov results hoping something matches. That's not a strategy - that's gambling.
>
> The Hit List Method is simple:
>
> **Step 1:** Filter by your NAICS codes. Start with what you actually do.
>
> **Step 2:** Cross-reference with your target agencies. Remember those top 3 you picked? Focus there.
>
> **Step 3:** Score by competition level. Fewer bidders equals better odds.
>
> The formula is right here on screen: Low competition + Right NAICS + Target Agency = High probability win.
>
> This is how you stop wasting time on opportunities you were never going to win anyway."

**Transition:** "But here's a secret most contractors don't know about..."

---

## SLIDE 9: The Sources Sought Secret
**Less than 5% of contractors respond**

### Talking Points:
> "Look at this number. Less than 5%.
>
> Less than 5% of contractors respond to Sources Sought notices.
>
> Let that sink in. If you respond to a Sources Sought, you're AUTOMATICALLY in the top 5%. Just by showing up.
>
> But it gets better. When you respond to a Sources Sought, you can actually INFLUENCE how the agency writes the final requirement. You're shaping the opportunity before it even drops.
>
> Most contractors ignore these because they don't think they're 'real' opportunities. They're waiting for the RFP. By then, it's too late - someone else already shaped the requirement to favor THEIR solution.
>
> This week, I want you to find ONE Sources Sought notice in your NAICS and respond to it. That's it. One response puts you ahead of 95% of your competition."

**Transition:** "Now let's talk about the fastest path to contracts..."

---

## SLIDE 10: Strategy #5 - Expiring Contracts
**Two Paths: Team WITH or Compete AGAINST**

### Talking Points:
> "Strategy #5: Expiring contracts.
>
> The fastest path to a contract isn't chasing new opportunities. It's positioning on contracts that are about to recompete.
>
> When a contract expires, it gets rebid. And you have two options:
>
> **Path A: Team WITH the incumbent.** They need small business subcontractors. They need to show diversity in their proposal. You can ride along, get past performance, lower your risk.
>
> **Path B: Compete AGAINST the incumbent.** Position yourself as the better option. Higher risk, but if you win, you're the prime.
>
> Either way, the key is TIMING. The sweet spot is 12-18 months before expiration. That's when agencies start market research. That's when incumbents start building their teams.
>
> If you wait until the RFP drops, you're already too late."

**Transition:** "Alright, I just gave you 5 strategies. Now here's what I want you to do with them..."

---

## SLIDE 11: Your Challenge This Week

### Talking Points:
> "Here's my challenge to you. Pick ONE. Just one.
>
> **Option 1:** Pick your 3 target agencies. Write them down tonight. Not tomorrow - tonight.
>
> **Option 2:** Respond to one Sources Sought notice. Get on an agency's radar.
>
> **Option 3:** Find 3 expiring contracts in your NAICS. Go to USASpending.gov. Add them to your pipeline.
>
> **Option 4:** Research one agency using AI. Know their spending, know their pain points, before you ever reach out.
>
> One action. That's all it takes to start building momentum.
>
> Drop in the chat which one you're going to do. I want to see it."

**Transition:** "Before we move on, let's do some Q&A..."

---

## SLIDE 12: Q&A Time

### Talking Points:
> "Alright, Q&A time. Drop your questions in the chat.
>
> While questions are coming in, let me hit some of the common ones:
>
> **'How do I find contracting officers?'** FPDS, USASpending, agency OSDBU offices. Or use our Government Buyers database - I'll tell you about that in a minute.
>
> **'Do I need past performance to win?'** Not for micro-purchases under $10K. For larger contracts, commercial experience counts. Start small, build up.
>
> **'How do I team with primes?'** Don't just ask to team. Bring VALUE. Know what contracts they have. Know where they need small business support. Make it easy for them to say yes.
>
> **'Is 8(a) certification worth it?'** If you're eligible? Absolutely. Sole-source up to $4.5M for services, $7M for manufacturing. Game-changing.
>
> Who's already registered on SAM.gov? Drop a checkmark in the chat if you're set up."

*[Answer live questions for 5-10 minutes]*

**Transition:** "Alright, so I just taught you a LOT. Now let me show you how to shortcut all of this..."

---

## SLIDE 13: Want to Shortcut All of This?

### Talking Points:
> "Everything I just taught you tonight? There are tools that do the heavy lifting FOR you.
>
> I'm not saying don't learn the strategies - you should. But why spend weeks doing manually what you can do in minutes with the right tools?
>
> Let me show you what I'm talking about..."

**Transition:** "This is the Ultimate Giant Bundle..."

---

## SLIDE 14: The Ultimate Giant Bundle
