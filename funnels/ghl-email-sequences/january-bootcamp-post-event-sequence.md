## BUYER PSYCHOLOGY TARGETING

Each email targets one or more of the 5 buyer psychology types:

1. **Rock Bottom Buyer** - Just went through something (job loss, business failure). Buying transformation/new identity.
2. **Almost There Buyer** - Already tried courses/coaches. Looking for the "missing piece" that finally clicks.
3. **Identity Buyer** - Wants to FEEL like a government contractor. Buying the label, being "in the room."
4. **Escape Buyer** - Hates current job/life. Buying the fantasy of freedom/different life.
5. **Revenge Buyer** - Wants to prove someone wrong. Motivated by making doubters feel stupid.

---

## EMAIL 1 - Day 1 (Day After Bootcamp)
**Wait:** 1 day after bootcamp
**Subject:** You showed up. Now let's make it count.
**Psychology:** Identity Buyer + Escape Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

You did something yesterday that most people don't do.

**You showed up.**

8 hours. A full day. While everyone else was scrolling, complaining about their jobs, and dreaming about "someday"...

You were in the room. Building. Learning. Taking action.

That already separates you from 95% of people who SAY they want to get into government contracting.

You now have:
- Your personalized agency target list
- 3-5 matched opportunities to pursue
- A teaming strategy with prime contractors
- Your 90-day action plan

**But here's the truth nobody talks about:**

The bootcamp gave you the roadmap. What happens next is on you.

I've seen people take what they learned and win contracts within 90 days. They're now living a completely different life - no boss, no ceiling, no asking permission.

I've also seen people put their notes in a drawer and never look at them again. A year later, they're still in the same job, still complaining, still dreaming.

**Which one are you going to be?**

Here's your Week 1 action list:
1. Send ONE outreach email to an OSDBU contact (use the template)
2. Research ONE prime contractor from your teaming list
3. Review ONE opportunity from your hit list

That's it. Just three things this week.

Reply to this email and tell me which one you're starting with.

Talk soon,
Eric

P.S. As a Pro member, you already have Market Assassin Standard. Tomorrow I'll show you tools that pair with it to 10x your output.

---

## EMAIL 2 - Day 2
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** You have Market Assassin. Here's what's missing.
**Psychology:** Almost There Buyer (the missing piece)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

As a Pro member, you already have Market Assassin Standard.

You can generate 4 strategic reports from your inputs. That's a solid start.

**But if you're like most people I work with, you've probably felt this:**

You run the reports. You see the opportunities. You identify the primes.

Then you think... "Now what? How do I actually reach these people? What do I say?"

**Market Assassin shows you WHERE to go. But you're missing the tools to GET THERE.**

Here's what completes the picture:

---

**FEDERAL CONTRACTOR DATABASE - $497**

Market Assassin tells you which primes are in your space.

The Contractor Database gives you their:
- SBLO (Small Business Liaison Officer) contact info
- Vendor portal links
- NAICS codes they work in
- Contract history
- Teaming opportunities

**3,500+ primes searchable in seconds.**

Without this, you're Googling for hours trying to find contact info for the primes Market Assassin identified. That's the gap. That's why you're stuck.

---

**GOVCON CONTENT GENERATOR - $197**

Market Assassin tells you WHO to contact.

The Content Generator writes the outreach FOR you:
- Capability statements
- OSDBU introduction emails
- Teaming partner requests
- Proposal sections
- Follow-up sequences

**What takes 30 minutes now takes 3.**

You know what to do. You just don't know what to SAY. This fixes that.

---

**RECOMPETE/EXPIRING CONTRACTS DATABASE - $397**

Market Assassin shows you the market.

The Recompete Database shows you specific contracts expiring soon:
- Contract details and value
- Incumbent information
- Expiration dates
- Rebid timelines

**These are contracts you can bid on OR team with the incumbent.**

---

**Here's the math:**

| Tool | Price |
|------|-------|
| Federal Contractor Database | $497 |
| GovCon Content Generator | $197 |
| Recompete Database | $397 |
| **Total if bought separately** | **$1,091** |

**Or get the Ultimate Giant Bundle for $1,497** and get Premium versions of ALL tools (including upgrading your Market Assassin to Premium).

If you've tried courses, coaches, and YouTube videos and you're STILL not winning - this is the missing piece.

More on that tomorrow.

## EMAIL 3 - Day 3
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** The Ultimate Giant (for people who are done waiting)
**Psychology:** Rock Bottom Buyer + Escape Buyer + Revenge Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Let me talk to a specific person right now.

**The one who's done waiting.**

Maybe you've been "working on" getting into government contracting for months. Maybe years.

Maybe you're still in a job you hate, watching the clock, dreaming about the day you can finally walk away.

Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work. That government contracting is "too hard" or "not for people like us."

Maybe you've invested in courses and coaching before and you're still not where you want to be.

**I get it. And I'm not here to sell you another dream.**

I'm here to give you the tools that actually close the gap.

**The Ultimate Giant Bundle - $1,497**

Here's what you get:

✓ **Market Assassin PREMIUM** - Upgrade from 4 reports to 8 strategic reports
✓ **Federal Contractor Database PREMIUM** - 3,500+ searchable primes with contacts
✓ **GovCon Content Generator PREMIUM** - AI-powered proposals and outreach
✓ **Recompete Contracts Database PREMIUM** - Expiring contracts to pursue

**Total Value: $1,788**
**You Pay: $1,497**
**You Save: $291**

---

**Why this matters:**

You already have Market Assassin Standard. That means you understand the value of having intelligence at your fingertips.

But intelligence without execution is just expensive knowledge.

Ultimate Giant gives you the complete stack:

- Market Assassin tells you **WHERE** (the opportunities)
- Contractor Database tells you **WHO** (the contacts)
- Recompete Tracker tells you **WHEN** (the timing)
- Content Generator handles **WHAT** (what to say)

**This is how you stop "trying" and start doing.**

6 months from now, you could be in the exact same place - still researching, still preparing, still waiting.

Or you could be the person who finally made it happen. The one who proved everyone wrong.

**→ [Get Ultimate Giant - $1,497](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)**

Eric

P.S. One-time payment. Lifetime access. No subscriptions on the tools. This isn't another monthly drain. It's an investment in finally getting this done.

## EMAIL 4 - Day 4
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** "I spent 3 years spinning my wheels"
**Psychology:** Almost There Buyer + Rock Bottom Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Got this message last week:

*"I spent 3 years trying to break into government contracting. Courses. Webinars. YouTube. I knew all the theory but couldn't connect the dots. I ran Market Assassin and found 15 primes in my NAICS. Then I had to spend 3 hours Googling to find their SBLO contacts. I was about to give up.*

*Then I got the Contractor Database - same 15 primes, all contacts found in 5 minutes. Used the Content Generator to write my outreach. Sent 10 emails in an hour instead of a week.*

*I have 3 capability briefings scheduled. In 3 years I never had ONE. In 3 weeks with the right tools, I have THREE."*

---

Here's what hit me about that:

**3 years → 3 weeks.**

That's the difference between having pieces of the puzzle vs. having the complete picture.

You've probably already invested time. Money. Energy. You know more than most people about government contracting.

**The problem isn't knowledge. It's execution.**

And execution requires the right tools:

1. Market Assassin identifies primes in your space ✓ (you have this)
2. Contractor Database gives you their contact info
3. Content Generator writes your outreach
4. Recompete Tracker shows contracts they're rebidding

Each step without the tools = hours of manual work.
Each step WITH the tools = minutes.

**You're not starting from zero. You're closer than you think.**

The tools are the bridge between where you are and where you want to be.

**→ [Get Ultimate Giant - $1,497](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)** (all 4 tools, Premium versions)

Or pick the individual tools you need most:
- [Federal Contractor Database - $497](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)
- [Content Generator - $197](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)
- [Recompete Database - $397](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)

## EMAIL 5 - Day 5
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** Quick check-in (+ a reality check)
**Psychology:** Escape Buyer + Identity Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Quick check-in.

It's been almost a week since the bootcamp. How's it going?

Have you:
✓ Sent an outreach email to an OSDBU contact?
✓ Researched a prime contractor from your teaming list?
✓ Reviewed an opportunity from your hit list?

**If you have** - you're ahead of 90% of people who attend trainings. You're not just someone who TALKS about government contracting. You're someone who DOES it. That's a different identity.

**If you haven't** - no judgment. Life gets busy.

But let me give you a reality check:

**The Q1 spending window is open right now.**

Agencies have money. They need to spend it. And every week you wait is a week someone else is positioning themselves.

I'm not saying this to stress you out. I'm saying it because I've seen the pattern too many times:

People attend trainings. Get motivated. Go back to their regular life. And nothing changes.

A year later, they're still in the same job. Still watching the clock. Still dreaming about "someday."

**The difference between people who win contracts and people who don't isn't talent. It's action.**

One outreach email this week. That's all I'm asking.

You have Market Assassin. Use it to identify one agency. Find one contact. Send one email.

And if writing that email is the bottleneck - the Content Generator ($197) writes it for you in 3 minutes.

**→ [shop.govcongiants.org](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)**

**Need more accountability?** If you're someone who needs a coach walking you through this step-by-step - someone to keep you on track and answer your specific questions - we offer 1-on-1 coaching. Reply to this email with "COACHING" and I'll send you the details.

Talk soon,
Eric

## EMAIL 6 - Day 7 (1 Week Mark)
**Wait:** 2 days
**Subject:** Week 1 done. Here's how Week 2 separates winners from dreamers.
**Psychology:** Identity Buyer + Revenge Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Week 1 of your 90-day plan is complete.

Whether you crushed it or struggled - it doesn't matter. What matters is Week 2.

Because here's the truth:

**Week 1 is when everyone's motivated. Week 2 is when the real ones separate from the dreamers.**

Most people who attended the bootcamp? They're already slipping back into old patterns. The notes are in a folder. The action plan is "for later."

But not you. You're still here. You're still reading. You're still in the game.

**Here's your Week 2 focus:**

1. **Follow up** on any outreach you sent (most people don't follow up - that's your advantage)
2. **Identify 2 more primes** from your teaming list to research
3. **Set up 1 capability briefing** (OSDBU or prime contractor)

That last one is where the magic happens.

**Here's the capability briefing request template:**

---

*Subject: Capability Briefing Request - [Your Company] - [NAICS]

Dear [Name],

I'm the [title] of [Company], a [certification] small business specializing in [specific capability]. I noticed [Agency/Company] has requirements in [specific area].

Would you have 15 minutes this month for a brief capability overview? I'd love to learn more about your current initiatives and share how we might support your mission.

I've attached our capability statement for your reference.

Best regards,
[Your name]*

---

**Send that to ONE person this week.**

Imagine: 30 days from now, you've had 3-4 capability briefings. You've built real relationships. You're on people's radar.

When someone asks "how's the government contracting thing going?" you don't say "still working on it."

You say "I've got 3 meetings with prime contractors this month."

**That's a different person. That's a different identity.**

**Pro tip:** If you have the Content Generator, paste this template and tell it to customize for a specific agency or prime. It rewrites it with agency-specific language in 30 seconds.

## EMAIL 7 - Day 9
**Wait:** 2 days
**Subject:** The $197 tool that pays for itself in one week
**Psychology:** Almost There Buyer (ROI focused)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Let me tell you about the **GovCon Content Generator**.

It's $197. One-time. And it might be the highest-ROI tool in the stack.

**Here's what it writes for you:**

📧 **Outreach emails** - OSDBU introductions, prime contractor requests, follow-ups
📄 **Capability statements** - Customized for specific agencies or opportunities
📝 **Proposal sections** - Technical approach, past performance narratives, management plans
🤝 **Teaming requests** - Partner outreach that actually gets responses
💼 **Interview prep** - Capability briefing talking points

---

**The math (for the "Almost There" people who've tried everything):**

Let's say you spend 30 minutes writing each outreach email.

If you send 10 emails this month, that's 5 hours of writing.

With Content Generator? 10 emails in 30 minutes total.

**You save 4.5 hours. On just emails. In one month.**

Now multiply that by capability statements, proposal sections, follow-ups...

---

**Here's why this matters if you've been stuck:**

You've taken the courses. You've done the research. You know what you SHOULD be doing.

But when you sit down to write that email... you freeze. What do I say? How do I sound professional without being boring? What if I say the wrong thing?

**The Content Generator eliminates that friction.**

You tell it who you're writing to and what you want. It gives you professional, GovCon-specific content in seconds.

No more staring at a blank screen. No more "I'll do it tomorrow." No more excuses.

**$197 pays for itself the first week you use it.**

**→ [Get Content Generator - $197](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)**

Or bundle it with everything else:
**→ [Ultimate Giant - $1,497](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)** (all 4 Premium tools)

## EMAIL 8 - Day 11
**Wait:** 2 days
**Subject:** The real reason you haven't won a contract yet
**Psychology:** Rock Bottom + Almost There + Escape Buyer

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Can I be brutally honest with you?

I've been doing this long enough to know why most people fail at government contracting.

It's not because they're not qualified.
It's not because they don't have certifications.
It's not because they don't work hard.

**It's because they get stuck in "research mode."**

They spend months "learning." Gathering information. Reading about opportunities. Watching YouTube videos. Attending webinars. Taking courses.

But they never actually DO anything.

No outreach emails sent.
No capability briefings scheduled.
No proposals submitted.

**Sound familiar?**

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

**Information without action is just entertainment.**

It FEELS productive. You're "working on" your government contracting business. You're "getting ready."

But a year goes by and you're still in the same place. Still at the same job. Still dreaming about the day you can walk away.

---

**You have everything you need to start:**

- The bootcamp training ✓
- Market Assassin ✓
- The action plan ✓
- The templates ✓

The question is: **Are you going to use them?**

And if research or writing is slowing you down, these tools eliminate the excuse:

- **Contractor Database** finds your teaming partners FOR you ($497)
- **Content Generator** writes your outreach FOR you ($197)
- **Recompete Tracker** identifies opportunities FOR you ($397)
- **Ultimate Giant** gives you all Premium tools ($1,497)

But even with the best tools in the world... **you still have to press send.**

---

**Here's the real question:**

Do you need tools? Or do you need someone in your corner?

Some people just need the right tools and they'll execute. The bundles are perfect for them.

**But some people need more.**

They need accountability. They need someone to walk them through it. They need a coach who will keep them on track, answer their specific questions, and make sure they actually follow through.

**If that's you - we have 1-on-1 coaching.**

You get a dedicated coach who:
- Reviews your specific situation
- Creates a customized action plan
- Holds you accountable to deadlines
- Answers your questions directly
- Makes sure you don't stay stuck

**Reply with "COACHING" if you want details.**

---

**What's one action you can take TODAY?**

Not tomorrow. Not this weekend. Today.

Reply and tell me. I read every response.

## EMAIL 9 - Day 13
**Wait:** 2 days
**Subject:** 30 days from now (two different lives)
**Psychology:** Escape Buyer + Revenge Buyer + Rock Bottom

---

{{contact.first_name}},

It's been about 2 weeks since the bootcamp.

Let me show you two different futures:

---

**FUTURE 1: You take consistent action**

30 days from now:
- You've sent 8-10 outreach emails to OSDBU contacts and primes
- You've scheduled 2-3 capability briefings
- You've identified 5+ specific opportunities to pursue
- You've started building relationships with potential teaming partners
- You've submitted your first response to an RFI or Sources Sought

You're IN THE GAME. You have momentum. You have real conversations happening.

When that person who doubted you asks how things are going, you don't mumble something about "still working on it."

You say: "I've got meetings with three prime contractors this month and I'm pursuing two opportunities."

**Watch their face change.**

---

**FUTURE 2: You don't take action**

30 days from now:
- Your bootcamp notes are in a folder somewhere
- You keep meaning to "get to it"
- But life is busy
- And every day it gets easier to push it to tomorrow

You're in the same place you were before the bootcamp. Same job. Same frustration. Same dreams that never become reality.

When someone asks how the government contracting thing is going, you change the subject.

---

**I'm not trying to guilt you.**

I'm trying to show you what's at stake.

You invested 8 hours in that bootcamp. You have Market Assassin. You have everything you need to start.

**The only question is: Which future do you want?**

---

**Tools that make Future 1 inevitable:**

| Tool | Price | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Content Generator | $197 | Writes your outreach and proposals |
| Contractor Database | $497 | Finds primes with contact info |
| Recompete Tracker | $397 | Shows expiring contracts to pursue |
| **Ultimate Giant** | **$1,497** | **All 4 tools, Premium versions** |

**→ [shop.govcongiants.org](https://shop.govcongiants.org/)**

Eric

## EMAIL 10 - Day 14 (Final)
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** Last email (and a question that matters)
**Psychology:** All 5 types - final push

---

{{contact.first_name}},

This is the last email in this sequence.

Before I go, I want to ask you something:

**Why did you sign up for the bootcamp in the first place?**

Really think about it.

---

Maybe you just went through something - lost a job, closed a business, hit a wall - and you're looking for a way to rebuild. A fresh start. A new identity.

*→ The tools are your foundation for that new chapter.*

---

Maybe you've been trying to crack government contracting for months or years. You've taken courses. Watched videos. Done the research. You know you're close - you just need the missing piece that finally makes it click.

*→ The tools ARE that missing piece. They bridge the gap between knowledge and action.*

---

Maybe you want to feel like a REAL government contractor. Not someone who's "working on it" - someone who's actually in the game. In the room. Part of something.

*→ Sending real outreach, scheduling real meetings, pursuing real opportunities - that's what makes you real.*

---

Maybe you hate your current situation. The job. The boss. The ceiling. You want OUT. Government contracting is your escape route.

*→ Every email you don't send is another day stuck where you are.*

---

Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work. That you couldn't do it. And you want to prove them wrong so badly you can taste it.

*→ Imagine their face when you tell them about your first contract.*

---

**Whatever your reason - the path forward is the same:**

Take action. This week. Today.

I've given you:
- The bootcamp training
- Market Assassin (with your Pro membership)
- The templates
- The action plan
- The tool recommendations

**Now it's on you.**

---

**My final request:**

Reply to this email and tell me **ONE thing you're going to do this week.**

Not a wish. Not a "I should." An actual commitment.

- "I'm going to send 2 outreach emails to primes on my teaming list"
- "I'm going to schedule a call with my APEX Accelerator counselor"
- "I'm going to respond to the Sources Sought I found in my NAICS"

Whatever it is - write it down. Send it to me.

**Accountability changes everything.**

I'll be cheering you on.

And when you win that first contract - whether it's 90 days or 9 months from now - I want to hear about it.

**Let's go.**
