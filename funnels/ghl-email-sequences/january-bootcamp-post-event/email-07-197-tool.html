<p>Let me tell you about the <strong>GovCon Content Generator</strong>.</p>

<p>It's $197. One-time. And it might be the highest-ROI tool in the stack.</p>

<p><strong>Here's what it writes for you:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>📧 <strong>Outreach emails</strong> - OSDBU introductions, prime contractor requests, follow-ups</li>
    <li>📄 <strong>Capability statements</strong> - Customized for specific agencies or opportunities</li>
    <li>📝 <strong>Proposal sections</strong> - Technical approach, past performance narratives, management plans</li>
    <li>🤝 <strong>Teaming requests</strong> - Partner outreach that actually gets responses</li>
    <li>💼 <strong>Interview prep</strong> - Capability briefing talking points</li>
</ul>

<p style="background: #fef3c7; border: 1px solid #f59e0b; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 20px 0;">
    <strong>The math (for the "Almost There" people who've tried everything):</strong><br><br>
    Let's say you spend 30 minutes writing each outreach email.<br>
    If you send 10 emails this month, that's 5 hours of writing.<br>
    With Content Generator? 10 emails in 30 minutes total.<br><br>
    <strong>You save 4.5 hours. On just emails. In one month.</strong><br><br>
    Now multiply that by capability statements, proposal sections, follow-ups...
</p>

<p><strong>Here's why this matters if you've been stuck:</strong></p>

<p>You've taken the courses. You've done the research. You know what you SHOULD be doing.</p>

<p>But when you sit down to write that email... you freeze. What do I say? How do I sound professional without being boring? What if I say the wrong thing?</p>

<p><strong>The Content Generator eliminates that friction.</strong></p>

<p>You tell it who you're writing to and what you want. It gives you professional, GovCon-specific content in seconds.</p>

<p>No more staring at a blank screen. No more "I'll do it tomorrow." No more excuses.</p>

<p><strong>$197 pays for itself the first week you use it.</strong></p>
