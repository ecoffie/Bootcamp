<p>Week 1 of your 90-day plan is complete.</p>

<p>Whether you crushed it or struggled - it doesn't matter. What matters is Week 2.</p>

<p>Because here's the truth:</p>

<p><strong>Week 1 is when everyone's motivated. Week 2 is when the real ones separate from the dreamers.</strong></p>

<p>Most people who attended the bootcamp? They're already slipping back into old patterns. The notes are in a folder. The action plan is "for later."</p>

<p>But not you. You're still here. You're still reading. You're still in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Here's your Week 2 focus:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Follow up</strong> on any outreach you sent (most people don't follow up - that's your advantage)</li>
    <li><strong>Identify 2 more primes</strong> from your teaming list to research</li>
    <li><strong>Set up 1 capability briefing</strong> (OSDBU or prime contractor)</li>
</ol>

<p>That last one is where the magic happens.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the capability briefing request template:</strong></p>

    <strong>Subject:</strong> Capability Briefing Request - [Your Company] - [NAICS]<br><br>
    Dear [Name],<br><br>
    I'm the [title] of [Company], a [certification] small business specializing in [specific capability]. I noticed [Agency/Company] has requirements in [specific area].<br><br>
    Would you have 15 minutes this month for a brief capability overview? I'd love to learn more about your current initiatives and share how we might support your mission.<br><br>
    I've attached our capability statement for your reference.<br><br>
    Best regards,<br>
    [Your name]
</p>

<p><strong>Send that to ONE person this week.</strong></p>

<p>Imagine: 30 days from now, you've had 3-4 capability briefings. You've built real relationships. You're on people's radar.</p>

<p>When someone asks "how's the government contracting thing going?" you don't say "still working on it."</p>

<p>You say "I've got 3 meetings with prime contractors this month."</p>

<p><strong>That's a different person. That's a different identity.</strong></p>
