<p>Quick check-in.</p>

<p>It's been almost a week since the bootcamp. How's it going?</p>

<p>Have you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✓ Sent an outreach email to an OSDBU contact?</li>
    <li>✓ Researched a prime contractor from your teaming list?</li>
    <li>✓ Reviewed an opportunity from your hit list?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have</strong> - you're ahead of 90% of people who attend trainings. You're not just someone who TALKS about government contracting. You're someone who DOES it. That's a different identity.</p>

<p><strong>If you haven't</strong> - no judgment. Life gets busy.</p>

<p>But let me give you a reality check:</p>

<p><strong>The Q1 spending window is open right now.</strong></p>

<p>Agencies have money. They need to spend it. And every week you wait is a week someone else is positioning themselves.</p>

<p>I'm not saying this to stress you out. I'm saying it because I've seen the pattern too many times:</p>

<p>People attend trainings. Get motivated. Go back to their regular life. And nothing changes.</p>

<p>A year later, they're still in the same job. Still watching the clock. Still dreaming about "someday."</p>

<p><strong>The difference between people who win contracts and people who don't isn't talent. It's action.</strong></p>

<p>One outreach email this week. That's all I'm asking.</p>

<p>You have Market Assassin. Use it to identify one agency. Find one contact. Send one email.</p>

<p>And if writing that email is the bottleneck - the Content Generator ($197) writes it for you in 3 minutes.</p>
