<!-- EMAIL 1 - Day 1 (Day After Bootcamp) -->
<!-- Subject: You showed up. Now let's make it count. -->
<!-- Wait: 1 day after bootcamp | Psychology: Identity + Escape Buyer -->

<p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p>You did something yesterday that most people don't do.</p>

<p><strong>You showed up.</strong></p>

<p>8 hours. A full day. While everyone else was scrolling, complaining about their jobs, and dreaming about "someday"...</p>

<p>You were in the room. Building. Learning. Taking action.</p>

<p>That already separates you from 95% of people who SAY they want to get into government contracting.</p>

<p>You now have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your personalized agency target list</li>
    <li>3-5 matched opportunities to pursue</li>
    <li>A teaming strategy with prime contractors</li>
    <li>Your 90-day action plan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But here's the truth nobody talks about:</strong></p>

<p>The bootcamp gave you the roadmap. What happens next is on you.</p>

<p>I've seen people take what they learned and win contracts within 90 days. They're now living a completely different life - no boss, no ceiling, no asking permission.</p>

<p>I've also seen people put their notes in a drawer and never look at them again. A year later, they're still in the same job, still complaining, still dreaming.</p>

<p><strong>Which one are you going to be?</strong></p>

<p>Here's your Week 1 action list:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Send ONE outreach email to an OSDBU contact (use the template)</li>
    <li>Research ONE prime contractor from your teaming list</li>
    <li>Review ONE opportunity from your hit list</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. Just three things this week.</p>

<p>Reply to this email and tell me which one you're starting with.</p>

<p>Talk soon,<br>Eric</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> As a Pro member, you already have Market Assassin Standard. Tomorrow I'll show you tools that pair with it to 10x your output.</p>
