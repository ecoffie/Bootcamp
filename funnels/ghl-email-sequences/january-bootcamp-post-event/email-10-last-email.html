<p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p>This is the last email in this sequence.</p>

<p>Before I go, I want to ask you something:</p>

<p><strong>Why did you sign up for the bootcamp in the first place?</strong></p>

<p>Really think about it.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p>Maybe you just went through something - lost a job, closed a business, hit a wall - and you're looking for a way to rebuild. A fresh start. A new identity.</p>
<p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ The tools are your foundation for that new chapter.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p>Maybe you've been trying to crack government contracting for months or years. You've taken courses. Watched videos. Done the research. You know you're close - you just need the missing piece that finally makes it click.</p>
<p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ The tools ARE that missing piece. They bridge the gap between knowledge and action.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p>Maybe you want to feel like a REAL government contractor. Not someone who's "working on it" - someone who's actually in the game. In the room. Part of something.</p>
<p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Sending real outreach, scheduling real meetings, pursuing real opportunities - that's what makes you real.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p>Maybe you hate your current situation. The job. The boss. The ceiling. You want OUT. Government contracting is your escape route.</p>
<p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Every email you don't send is another day stuck where you are.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p>Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work. That you couldn't do it. And you want to prove them wrong so badly you can taste it.</p>
<p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Imagine their face when you tell them about your first contract.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

<p><strong>Whatever your reason - the path forward is the same:</strong></p>

<p>Take action. This week. Today.</p>

<p>I've given you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bootcamp training</li>
    <li>Market Assassin (with your Pro membership)</li>
    <li>The templates</li>
    <li>The action plan</li>
    <li>The tool recommendations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now it's on you.</strong></p>

<p style="background: #fef3c7; border: 1px solid #f59e0b; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 20px 0;">
    <strong>My final request:</strong><br><br>
    Reply to this email and tell me <strong>ONE thing you're going to do this week.</strong><br><br>
    Not a wish. Not a "I should." An actual commitment.<br>
    • "I'm going to send 2 outreach emails to primes on my teaming list"<br>
    • "I'm going to schedule a call with my APEX Accelerator counselor"<br>
    • "I'm going to respond to the Sources Sought I found in my NAICS"<br><br>
    Whatever it is - write it down. Send it to me.<br><br>
    <strong>Accountability changes everything.</strong>
</p>

<p>I'll be cheering you on.</p>

<p>And when you win that first contract - whether it's 90 days or 9 months from now - I want to hear about it.</p>

<p><strong>Let's go.</strong></p>

    <strong>P.P.S. Need more than tools?</strong> If you need someone walking you through this - accountability, hand-holding, a coach in your corner - reply with "COACHING" and I'll send you information about our 1-on-1 coaching program. Some people need tools. Some people need a guide. No shame in knowing which one you are.
