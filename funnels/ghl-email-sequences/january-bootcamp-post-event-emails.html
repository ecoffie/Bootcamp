    <div class="email-header">
        <h2>EMAIL 1 - Day 1 (Day After Bootcamp)</h2>
        <p>Wait: 1 day after bootcamp | Psychology: Identity + Escape Buyer</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-line">
        Subject: You showed up. Now let's make it count.
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>You did something yesterday that most people don't do.</p>

        <p><strong>You showed up.</strong></p>

        <p>8 hours. A full day. While everyone else was scrolling, complaining about their jobs, and dreaming about "someday"...</p>

        <p>You were in the room. Building. Learning. Taking action.</p>

        <p>That already separates you from 95% of people who SAY they want to get into government contracting.</p>

        <p>You now have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your personalized agency target list</li>
            <li>3-5 matched opportunities to pursue</li>
            <li>A teaming strategy with prime contractors</li>
            <li>Your 90-day action plan</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>But here's the truth nobody talks about:</strong></p>

        <p>The bootcamp gave you the roadmap. What happens next is on you.</p>

        <p>I've seen people take what they learned and win contracts within 90 days. They're now living a completely different life - no boss, no ceiling, no asking permission.</p>

        <p>I've also seen people put their notes in a drawer and never look at them again. A year later, they're still in the same job, still complaining, still dreaming.</p>

        <p><strong>Which one are you going to be?</strong></p>

        <p>Here's your Week 1 action list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send ONE outreach email to an OSDBU contact (use the template)</li>
            <li>Research ONE prime contractor from your teaming list</li>
            <li>Review ONE opportunity from your hit list</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That's it. Just three things this week.</p>

        <p>Reply to this email and tell me which one you're starting with.</p>

        <div class="signature">
            <p>Talk soon,<br>Eric</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ps-section">
            <p><strong>P.S.</strong> As a Pro member, you already have Market Assassin Standard. Tomorrow I'll show you tools that pair with it to 10x your output.</p>

<div class="email-container">
    <div class="email-header">
        <h2>EMAIL 2 - Day 2</h2>
        <p>Wait: 1 day | Psychology: Almost There Buyer (the missing piece)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-line">
        Subject: You have Market Assassin. Here's what's missing.
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>As a Pro member, you already have Market Assassin Standard.</p>

        <p>You can generate 4 strategic reports from your inputs. That's a solid start.</p>

        <p><strong>But if you're like most people I work with, you've probably felt this:</strong></p>

        <p>You run the reports. You see the opportunities. You identify the primes.</p>

        <p>Then you think... "Now what? How do I actually reach these people? What do I say?"</p>

        <p><strong>Market Assassin shows you WHERE to go. But you're missing the tools to GET THERE.</strong></p>

        <p>Here's what completes the picture:</p>

        <div class="tool-box">
            <h4>FEDERAL CONTRACTOR DATABASE - $497</h4>
            <p>Market Assassin tells you which primes are in your space.</p>
            <p>The Contractor Database gives you their:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SBLO (Small Business Liaison Officer) contact info</li>
                <li>Vendor portal links</li>
                <li>NAICS codes they work in</li>
                <li>Contract history</li>
                <li>Teaming opportunities</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3,500+ primes searchable in seconds.</strong></p>
            <p>Without this, you're Googling for hours trying to find contact info for the primes Market Assassin identified. That's the gap. That's why you're stuck.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-box">
            <h4>GOVCON CONTENT GENERATOR - $197</h4>
            <p>Market Assassin tells you WHO to contact.</p>
            <p>The Content Generator writes the outreach FOR you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capability statements</li>
                <li>OSDBU introduction emails</li>
                <li>Teaming partner requests</li>
                <li>Proposal sections</li>
                <li>Follow-up sequences</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What takes 30 minutes now takes 3.</strong></p>
            <p>You know what to do. You just don't know what to SAY. This fixes that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-box">
            <h4>RECOMPETE/EXPIRING CONTRACTS DATABASE - $397</h4>
            <p>Market Assassin shows you the market.</p>
            <p>The Recompete Database shows you specific contracts expiring soon:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contract details and value</li>
                <li>Incumbent information</li>
                <li>Expiration dates</li>
                <li>Rebid timelines</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>These are contracts you can bid on OR team with the incumbent.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Here's the math:</strong></p>

        <table class="price-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Tool</th>
                <th>Price</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Federal Contractor Database</td>
                <td>$497</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GovCon Content Generator</td>
                <td>$197</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Recompete Database</td>
                <td>$397</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Total if bought separately</strong></td>
                <td><strong>$1,091</strong></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Or get the Ultimate Giant Bundle for $1,497</strong> and get Premium versions of ALL tools (including upgrading your Market Assassin to Premium).</p>

        <p>If you've tried courses, coaches, and YouTube videos and you're STILL not winning - this is the missing piece.</p>

        <p>More on that tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>EMAIL 3 - Day 3</h2>
        <p>Wait: 1 day | Psychology: Rock Bottom + Escape + Revenge Buyer</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-line">
        Subject: The Ultimate Giant (for people who are done waiting)
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>Let me talk to a specific person right now.</p>

        <p><strong>The one who's done waiting.</strong></p>

        <p>Maybe you've been "working on" getting into government contracting for months. Maybe years.</p>

        <p>Maybe you're still in a job you hate, watching the clock, dreaming about the day you can finally walk away.</p>

        <p>Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work. That government contracting is "too hard" or "not for people like us."</p>

        <p>Maybe you've invested in courses and coaching before and you're still not where you want to be.</p>

        <p><strong>I get it. And I'm not here to sell you another dream.</strong></p>

        <p>I'm here to give you the tools that actually close the gap.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">The Ultimate Giant Bundle - $1,497</h3>
            <p>Here's what you get:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✓ <strong>Market Assassin PREMIUM</strong> - Upgrade from 4 reports to 8 strategic reports</li>
                <li>✓ <strong>Federal Contractor Database PREMIUM</strong> - 3,500+ searchable primes with contacts</li>
                <li>✓ <strong>GovCon Content Generator PREMIUM</strong> - AI-powered proposals and outreach</li>
                <li>✓ <strong>Recompete Contracts Database PREMIUM</strong> - Expiring contracts to pursue</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Total Value: $1,788</strong><br>
            <strong>You Pay: $1,497</strong><br>
            <strong>You Save: $291</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>

        <p>You already have Market Assassin Standard. That means you understand the value of having intelligence at your fingertips.</p>

        <p>But intelligence without execution is just expensive knowledge.</p>

        <p>Ultimate Giant gives you the complete stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Market Assassin tells you <strong>WHERE</strong> (the opportunities)</li>
            <li>Contractor Database tells you <strong>WHO</strong> (the contacts)</li>
            <li>Recompete Tracker tells you <strong>WHEN</strong> (the timing)</li>
            <li>Content Generator handles <strong>WHAT</strong> (what to say)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>This is how you stop "trying" and start doing.</strong></p>

        <p>6 months from now, you could be in the exact same place - still researching, still preparing, still waiting.</p>

        <p>Or you could be the person who finally made it happen. The one who proved everyone wrong.</p>

        <div class="ps-section">
            <p><strong>P.S.</strong> One-time payment. Lifetime access. No subscriptions on the tools. This isn't another monthly drain. It's an investment in finally getting this done.</p>

        <h2>EMAIL 4 - Day 4</h2>
        <p>Wait: 1 day | Psychology: Almost There + Rock Bottom Buyer</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-line">
        Subject: "I spent 3 years spinning my wheels"
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>Got this message last week:</p>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"I spent 3 years trying to break into government contracting. Courses. Webinars. YouTube. I knew all the theory but couldn't connect the dots. I ran Market Assassin and found 15 primes in my NAICS. Then I had to spend 3 hours Googling to find their SBLO contacts. I was about to give up.</p>
            <p>Then I got the Contractor Database - same 15 primes, all contacts found in 5 minutes. Used the Content Generator to write my outreach. Sent 10 emails in an hour instead of a week.</p>
            <p>I have 3 capability briefings scheduled. In 3 years I never had ONE. In 3 weeks with the right tools, I have THREE."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Here's what hit me about that:</p>

        <p><strong>3 years → 3 weeks.</strong></p>

        <p>That's the difference between having pieces of the puzzle vs. having the complete picture.</p>

        <p>You've probably already invested time. Money. Energy. You know more than most people about government contracting.</p>

        <p><strong>The problem isn't knowledge. It's execution.</strong></p>

        <p>And execution requires the right tools:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Market Assassin identifies primes in your space ✓ (you have this)</li>
            <li>Contractor Database gives you their contact info</li>
            <li>Content Generator writes your outreach</li>
            <li>Recompete Tracker shows contracts they're rebidding</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Each step without the tools = hours of manual work.<br>
        Each step WITH the tools = minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>You're not starting from zero. You're closer than you think.</strong></p>

        <p>The tools are the bridge between where you are and where you want to be.</p>

        <p><a href="https://shop.govcongiants.org/" class="cta-button">Get Ultimate Giant - $1,497 →</a></p>

        <p>Or pick the individual tools you need most:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://shop.govcongiants.org/">Federal Contractor Database - $497</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://shop.govcongiants.org/">Content Generator - $197</a></li>

        <p>Quick check-in.</p>

        <p>It's been almost a week since the bootcamp. How's it going?</p>

        <p>Have you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✓ Sent an outreach email to an OSDBU contact?</li>
            <li>✓ Researched a prime contractor from your teaming list?</li>
            <li>✓ Reviewed an opportunity from your hit list?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you have</strong> - you're ahead of 90% of people who attend trainings. You're not just someone who TALKS about government contracting. You're someone who DOES it. That's a different identity.</p>

        <p><strong>If you haven't</strong> - no judgment. Life gets busy.</p>

        <p>But let me give you a reality check:</p>

        <p><strong>The Q1 spending window is open right now.</strong></p>

        <p>Agencies have money. They need to spend it. And every week you wait is a week someone else is positioning themselves.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying this to stress you out. I'm saying it because I've seen the pattern too many times:</p>

        <p>People attend trainings. Get motivated. Go back to their regular life. And nothing changes.</p>

        <p>A year later, they're still in the same job. Still watching the clock. Still dreaming about "someday."</p>

        <p><strong>The difference between people who win contracts and people who don't isn't talent. It's action.</strong></p>

        <p>One outreach email this week. That's all I'm asking.</p>

        <p>You have Market Assassin. Use it to identify one agency. Find one contact. Send one email.</p>

        <p>And if writing that email is the bottleneck - the Content Generator ($197) writes it for you in 3 minutes.</p>

        <h2>EMAIL 6 - Day 7 (1 Week Mark)</h2>
        <p>Wait: 2 days | Psychology: Identity + Revenge Buyer</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-line">
        Subject: Week 1 done. Here's how Week 2 separates winners from dreamers.
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>Week 1 of your 90-day plan is complete.</p>

        <p>Whether you crushed it or struggled - it doesn't matter. What matters is Week 2.</p>

        <p>Because here's the truth:</p>

        <p><strong>Week 1 is when everyone's motivated. Week 2 is when the real ones separate from the dreamers.</strong></p>

        <p>Most people who attended the bootcamp? They're already slipping back into old patterns. The notes are in a folder. The action plan is "for later."</p>

        <p>But not you. You're still here. You're still reading. You're still in the game.</p>

        <p><strong>Here's your Week 2 focus:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Follow up</strong> on any outreach you sent (most people don't follow up - that's your advantage)</li>
            <li><strong>Identify 2 more primes</strong> from your teaming list to research</li>
            <li><strong>Set up 1 capability briefing</strong> (OSDBU or prime contractor)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That last one is where the magic happens.</p>

        <p><strong>Here's the capability briefing request template:</strong></p>

        <div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 20px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px;">
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Capability Briefing Request - [Your Company] - [NAICS]</p>
            <p>Dear [Name],</p>
            <p>I'm the [title] of [Company], a [certification] small business specializing in [specific capability]. I noticed [Agency/Company] has requirements in [specific area].</p>
            <p>Would you have 15 minutes this month for a brief capability overview? I'd love to learn more about your current initiatives and share how we might support your mission.</p>
            <p>I've attached our capability statement for your reference.</p>
            <p>Best regards,<br>[Your name]</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Send that to ONE person this week.</strong></p>

        <p>Imagine: 30 days from now, you've had 3-4 capability briefings. You've built real relationships. You're on people's radar.</p>

        <p>When someone asks "how's the government contracting thing going?" you don't say "still working on it."</p>

        <p>You say "I've got 3 meetings with prime contractors this month."</p>

        <p><strong>That's a different person. That's a different identity.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you have the Content Generator, paste this template and tell it to customize for a specific agency or prime. It rewrites it with agency-specific language in 30 seconds.</p>

        <h2>EMAIL 7 - Day 9</h2>

        Subject: The $197 tool that pays for itself in one week
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>Let me tell you about the <strong>GovCon Content Generator</strong>.</p>

        <p>It's $197. One-time. And it might be the highest-ROI tool in the stack.</p>

        <p><strong>Here's what it writes for you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>📧 <strong>Outreach emails</strong> - OSDBU introductions, prime contractor requests, follow-ups</li>
            <li>📄 <strong>Capability statements</strong> - Customized for specific agencies or opportunities</li>
            <li>📝 <strong>Proposal sections</strong> - Technical approach, past performance narratives, management plans</li>
            <li>🤝 <strong>Teaming requests</strong> - Partner outreach that actually gets responses</li>
            <li>💼 <strong>Interview prep</strong> - Capability briefing talking points</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The math (for the "Almost There" people who've tried everything):</strong></p>
            <p>Let's say you spend 30 minutes writing each outreach email.</p>
            <p>If you send 10 emails this month, that's 5 hours of writing.</p>
            <p>With Content Generator? 10 emails in 30 minutes total.</p>
            <p><strong>You save 4.5 hours. On just emails. In one month.</strong></p>
            <p>Now multiply that by capability statements, proposal sections, follow-ups...</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Here's why this matters if you've been stuck:</strong></p>

        <p>You've taken the courses. You've done the research. You know what you SHOULD be doing.</p>

        <p>But when you sit down to write that email... you freeze. What do I say? How do I sound professional without being boring? What if I say the wrong thing?</p>

        <p><strong>The Content Generator eliminates that friction.</strong></p>

        <p>You tell it who you're writing to and what you want. It gives you professional, GovCon-specific content in seconds.</p>

        <p>No more staring at a blank screen. No more "I'll do it tomorrow." No more excuses.</p>

        <p><strong>$197 pays for itself the first week you use it.</strong></p>

        Subject: The real reason you haven't won a contract yet
    </div>

    <div class="email-body">
        <p>{{contact.first_name}},</p>

        <p>Can I be brutally honest with you?</p>

        <p>I've been doing this long enough to know why most people fail at government contracting.</p>

        <p>It's not because they're not qualified.<br>
        It's not because they don't have certifications.<br>
        It's not because they don't work hard.</p>

        <p><strong>It's because they get stuck in "research mode."</strong></p>

        <p>They spend months "learning." Gathering information. Reading about opportunities. Watching YouTube videos. Attending webinars. Taking courses.</p>

        <p>But they never actually DO anything.</p>

        <p>No outreach emails sent.<br>
        No capability briefings scheduled.<br>
        No proposals submitted.</p>

        <p><strong>Sound familiar?</strong></p>

        <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth:</p>

        <p><strong>Information without action is just entertainment.</strong></p>

        <p>It FEELS productive. You're "working on" your government contracting business. You're "getting ready."</p>

        <p>But a year goes by and you're still in the same place. Still at the same job. Still dreaming about the day you can walk away.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p><strong>You have everything you need to start:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bootcamp training ✓</li>
            <li>Market Assassin ✓</li>
            <li>The action plan ✓</li>
            <li>The templates ✓</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The question is: <strong>Are you going to use them?</strong></p>

        <p>And if research or writing is slowing you down, these tools eliminate the excuse:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contractor Database</strong> finds your teaming partners FOR you ($497)</li>
            <li><strong>Content Generator</strong> writes your outreach FOR you ($197)</li>
            <li><strong>Recompete Tracker</strong> identifies opportunities FOR you ($397)</li>
            <li><strong>Ultimate Giant</strong> gives you all Premium tools ($1,497)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But even with the best tools in the world... <strong>you still have to press send.</strong></p>

        <div class="coaching-box">
            <p><strong>Here's the real question:</strong></p>
            <p>Do you need tools? Or do you need someone in your corner?</p>

            <p><strong>But some people need more.</strong></p>
            <p>They need accountability. They need someone to walk them through it. They need a coach who will keep them on track, answer their specific questions, and make sure they actually follow through.</p>

            <p>30 days from now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You've sent 8-10 outreach emails to OSDBU contacts and primes</li>
                <li>You've scheduled 2-3 capability briefings</li>
                <li>You've identified 5+ specific opportunities to pursue</li>

                <li>You've submitted your first response to an RFI or Sources Sought</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You're IN THE GAME. You have momentum. You have real conversations happening.</p>
            <p>When that person who doubted you asks how things are going, you don't mumble something about "still working on it."</p>
            <p>You say: "I've got meetings with three prime contractors this month and I'm pursuing two opportunities."</p>

            <p>You're in the same place you were before the bootcamp. Same job. Same frustration. Same dreams that never become reality.</p>
            <p>When someone asks how the government contracting thing is going, you change the subject.</p>

        <p>Before I go, I want to ask you something:</p>

        <p><strong>Why did you sign up for the bootcamp in the first place?</strong></p>

        <p>Really think about it.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p>Maybe you just went through something - lost a job, closed a business, hit a wall - and you're looking for a way to rebuild. A fresh start. A new identity.</p>
        <p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ The tools are your foundation for that new chapter.</em></p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p>Maybe you've been trying to crack government contracting for months or years. You've taken courses. Watched videos. Done the research. You know you're close - you just need the missing piece that finally makes it click.</p>
        <p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ The tools ARE that missing piece. They bridge the gap between knowledge and action.</em></p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p>Maybe you want to feel like a REAL government contractor. Not someone who's "working on it" - someone who's actually in the game. In the room. Part of something.</p>
        <p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Sending real outreach, scheduling real meetings, pursuing real opportunities - that's what makes you real.</em></p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p>Maybe you hate your current situation. The job. The boss. The ceiling. You want OUT. Government contracting is your escape route.</p>
        <p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Every email you don't send is another day stuck where you are.</em></p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p>Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work. That you couldn't do it. And you want to prove them wrong so badly you can taste it.</p>
        <p style="color: #0369a1;"><em>→ Imagine their face when you tell them about your first contract.</em></p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb; margin: 30px 0;">

        <p><strong>Whatever your reason - the path forward is the same:</strong></p>

        <p>Take action. This week. Today.</p>

        <p>I've given you:</p>
