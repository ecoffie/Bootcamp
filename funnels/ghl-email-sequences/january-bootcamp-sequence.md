**Sequence:** 16 emails over 14 days + day-of + post-bootcamp

---

## EMAIL 1 - Immediate (Welcome + Resources)
**Wait:** 1 minute after signup
**Subject:** Your free resources are inside (+ what's next)

---

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Your free GovCon resources are ready:

✓ Agency Buyers List - Top 10 agencies with $82.8B in unobligated funds
✓ 34-Opportunity Hit List - Low-competition contracts you can win
✓ FY2026 NDAA Report - What the new defense bill means for you
✓ Agency Pain Points Guide - 8 problems you can solve
✓ Recompete Contracts List - 100 expiring contracts to target

**Download them here:** https://funnels-one.vercel.app/free-resources/resources.html

Now here's what I want you to do:

1. Open the Agency Buyers List
2. Find 2-3 agencies that match your NAICS codes
3. Write down their OSDBU contact info

That's it. Just that one step today.

I don't know your story. Maybe you've been trying to break into federal contracting for years and nothing's clicked yet. Maybe you just got your SAM registration and you're wondering "what now?" Maybe you're still stuck in a job you hate, dreaming about building something of your own.

Whatever brought you here - these resources are your starting point.

Tomorrow, I'll show you what to do next.

Talk soon,
Eric Coffie
GovCon Giants

P.S. If you want to skip ahead and get personalized help implementing all of this, I'm hosting an all-day bootcamp on January 31st. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

## EMAIL 2 - Day 2
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** The $82.8B question (and why you haven't gotten any of it)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Quick question:

Did you look at the Agency Buyers List yesterday?

If you did, you probably noticed something:

**$82.8 BILLION in unobligated balances.**

That's money agencies have been authorized to spend... but haven't spent yet.

Here's what keeps me up at night:

There are thousands of small business owners who are registered in SAM. Who have capability statements. Who've been to industry days. Who've done "everything right."

**And they still haven't won a single contract.**

Meanwhile, $82.8 billion sits there. Waiting.

If that's you - if you've been trying for months or even YEARS and you're wondering what the hell you're doing wrong - I want you to know something:

**It's not your fault.**

Nobody taught you how this actually works. The SBA gives you a checklist. YouTube gives you theory. But nobody shows you the actual playbook.

That's about to change.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the exact agencies where small businesses are winning right now - and why most people are targeting the wrong ones.

Eric

P.S. On January 31st, I'm spending 8 hours with a small group helping them find and pursue specific opportunities. If you're tired of spinning your wheels, join Pro here → https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

## EMAIL 3 - Day 3
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** While you were sleeping, these 3 agencies were spending

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Imagine this:

It's 6 months from now. You're not sitting in traffic. You're not answering to a boss who doesn't respect you. You're not watching the clock until 5pm.

Instead, you just got an email that your proposal was accepted. A $200K federal contract. YOUR contract.

Think about who you'd call first.

Maybe it's the person who said you were crazy for leaving your job. Maybe it's the family member who asked "when are you going to get a real business?" Maybe it's just yourself - proving that you could actually do this.

**That's not a fantasy. That's what happens when you target the right agencies.**

Here are 3 agencies actively spending right now:

**1. Department of Homeland Security**
- $4.2B in unobligated balances
- Hot areas: Cybersecurity, border tech, emergency management
- They're BEHIND on small business goals (desperate for you)

**2. Department of the Army**
- $10B+ sitting in accounts
- Hot areas: IT modernization, facilities, logistics
- Parent agency code: 2100 (use this in SAM.gov)

**3. Defense Logistics Agency**
- $5B in unobligated balances
- Hot areas: Supply chain, distribution, manufacturing
- They NEED small business manufacturers

While your coworkers are complaining about Monday... these agencies are looking for contractors.

**Here's what to do:**

1. Pick the ONE agency that best matches your capabilities
2. Go to SAM.gov
3. Search for opportunities using their parent agency code
4. Filter by your NAICS

That's your path out.

Eric

P.S. In the January 31st bootcamp, we'll do this exercise together - and you'll walk away with 3-5 real opportunities. Not theory. Real contracts you can pursue. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

## EMAIL 4 - Day 4
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** "We can't find qualified small businesses"

---

{{contact.first_name}},

I want to share something that might piss you off.

A few years ago, I was at an industry day. During the Q&A, a contracting officer said:

**"Our biggest problem isn't finding contracts. It's finding qualified small businesses who can actually do the work."**

Read that again.

While you're struggling to get noticed...

While you're wondering if you'll ever win a contract...

While you're questioning whether this whole thing is even possible...

**Agencies are literally COMPLAINING that they can't find you.**

How is that possible?

Because you're invisible. Not because you're not qualified. But because:

- Your SAM profile is generic (looks like 10,000 others)
- Your capability statement says "quality services" (means nothing)
- You're not reaching out to the right people
- You haven't positioned yourself as the solution to THEIR problems

If you've been trying for months or years and feeling like you're screaming into the void... this is why.

**You don't have a qualification problem. You have a visibility problem.**

And that's fixable.

Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how to become impossible to ignore.

Eric

P.S. At the bootcamp, we review capability statements live. You'll see exactly what works, what doesn't, and how to fix yours. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

---

## EMAIL 5 - Day 5
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** The one-page document that changes everything

---

{{contact.first_name}},

You've probably heard this before:

"You need a capability statement."

So you made one. Maybe you paid someone to design it. It looks professional. Has your logo. Lists your services.

**And it's not working.**

Here's why:

Most capability statements are written for YOU. They say what YOU do. What YOU offer. What YOU're capable of.

But contracting officers don't care about you.

They care about THEIR problems. THEIR mission. THEIR deadlines.

**The capability statement that wins isn't about you. It's about THEM.**

Instead of: "We provide quality IT services"
Write: "We help DoD agencies migrate legacy systems to the cloud - reducing downtime by 94%"

Instead of: "Professional consulting services"
Write: "We specialize in CMMC Level 2 compliance for small defense contractors"

See the difference?

One sounds like every other company.

The other sounds like someone who actually understands the problem.

**Here's what separates real federal contractors from people who just WISH they were federal contractors:**

Real contractors speak the agency's language. They reference specific missions. They solve specific problems.

Everyone else sends generic documents and wonders why nobody calls.

**Which one do you want to be?**

Tomorrow: The exact people you need to send this to (and most people don't even know they exist).

Eric

P.S. Want me to review your capability statement? At the January 31st bootcamp, we do live reviews. You'll know exactly what to fix. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

---

## EMAIL 6 - Day 6
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** The secret contact nobody uses

---

{{contact.first_name}},

What if I told you there's an office at every federal agency whose ENTIRE JOB is to help small businesses win contracts?

Not sell to you. Not gatekeep. Actually HELP.

They're called OSDBU - Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.

And almost nobody contacts them.

Why? Because most people don't know they exist. They're too busy mass-applying to SAM.gov opportunities like everyone else.

**What OSDBU can do for you:**
- Tell you about opportunities BEFORE they hit SAM.gov
- Introduce you directly to contracting officers
- Review your capability statement and give real feedback
- Connect you with prime contractors who need subs
- Literally advocate for your company inside the agency

This is the shortcut.

While everyone else is playing the lottery with SAM.gov... you're building relationships with people who can actually put you in the room.

**The Agency Buyers List I sent you has OSDBU contacts for the top 10 agencies.**

Here's what I want you to do today:

1. Open the Agency Buyers List
2. Find the OSDBU contact for your #1 target agency
3. Draft a 3-sentence email introducing yourself

Don't send it yet. Tomorrow, I'll give you the exact template that gets responses.

Eric

P.S. At the bootcamp, we help you identify your top 5 agencies AND craft your outreach strategy. This is how you stop being invisible. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

---

## EMAIL 7 - Day 7
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** Steal this email (gets 40%+ response rate)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Yesterday I told you to draft an OSDBU email.

Today I'm giving you the template that actually works.

But first - a quick story:

A member of ours had been trying to break into GovCon for 2 years. SAM registered. Capability statement done. Applied to dozens of opportunities.

**Zero responses.**

She was about to give up. Thought maybe this wasn't for her.

Then she sent ONE email to an OSDBU using this template.

Within a week, she had a meeting. Within a month, she was on a bidder's list. Within 90 days, she won her first contract.

**One email changed everything.**

Here's the template:

---

**Subject:** Small Business Introduction - [Your NAICS] - [Your Company Name]

Dear [OSDBU Contact Name],

I'm the [Title] of [Company Name], a [certification if applicable] small business specializing in [specific capability - not generic].

I'm reaching out because I noticed [Agency] has requirements in [specific area based on your research], and I believe we can support your mission. We recently [specific accomplishment with measurable result].

Would you have 15 minutes this month to discuss how we might support [Agency]'s small business goals?

I've attached our capability statement for your reference.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

---

**What makes this work:**
- Specific, not generic
- References THEIR needs (you did research)
- Asks for a small commitment (15 minutes)
- Includes proof you can deliver

**Send this to ONE OSDBU today.**

Not five. Not ten. Just one.

If you've been trying for years with no results... this is the pattern interrupt.

Eric

P.S. In the bootcamp, we help you identify exactly which OSDBU offices to contact first - and we role-play the conversations so you're ready. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

---

## EMAIL 8 - Day 8
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** Skip the line (the teaming shortcut)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Here's something nobody tells you about federal contracting:

**You don't have to start at the bottom.**

Some of the most successful small businesses I know never won a prime contract as their first deal.

They started as subcontractors. And that changed everything.

Think about it:

- Prime contractors MUST meet small business subcontracting goals (it's law)
- They're actively looking for qualified small businesses
- You get past performance without the risk of prime responsibility
- You build relationships that lead to future opportunities
- You get PAID while you're learning the game

While everyone else is banging their head against the wall trying to win a prime contract with zero past performance...

You could be making money, gaining experience, and building relationships.

**The Recompete Contracts List I sent you?**

It shows 100 contracts expiring soon. Each one lists the CURRENT incumbent.

Those incumbents will likely bid again. And they NEED small business subs.

**Imagine this:**

6 months from now, you're a subcontractor on a $10M contract. You're making real money. You have real past performance. And when you run into that person who doubted you?

You just smile. Because you're in the game now.

**Here's what to do:**

1. Open the Recompete Contracts List
2. Find 3 contracts in your NAICS
3. Look up the incumbent company
4. Find their small business liaison on LinkedIn
5. Reach out with the template from yesterday

That's how you skip the line.

Eric

P.S. At the bootcamp, we spend a full hour on teaming strategy. You'll identify 5 prime contractors to approach - and know exactly what to say. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

---

## EMAIL 9 - Day 9
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** How to spot a wired opportunity (stop wasting time)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

If you've been applying to federal opportunities and getting rejected over and over...

There's something you need to know:

**Some opportunities are wired before they're even posted.**

I know. It's frustrating as hell. But knowing this will save you months of wasted effort.

Here are the warning signs:

**🚩 Red flags (probably wired):**
- Requirements match one specific company perfectly
- 5 days or less to respond (nobody new can prepare in time)
- Incumbent just finished the previous contract
- References proprietary technology by name
- No industry day or Q&A period

**✅ Good signs (actually open):**
- Multiple NAICS codes listed
- 30+ day response window
- Sources Sought or RFI posted first
- Set-aside for small business
- Multiple industry days scheduled

**Here's the mindset shift:**

If you've been applying to everything and getting nowhere... you've probably been chasing wired opportunities.

That's not failure. That's just playing the wrong game.

The smart play? Even "wired" opportunities need small business subs. Position yourself as a subcontractor to whoever IS going to win.

Stop fighting the system. Start working it.

Eric

P.S. At the bootcamp, I'll show you how to evaluate opportunities in 5 minutes so you never waste time on the wrong ones again. https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

## EMAIL 10 - Day 10 (5 Days Left)
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** 5 days left (decision time)

---

{{contact.first_name}},

The January 31st bootcamp is in **5 days**.

Let me be real with you:

I don't know your specific situation. But if you downloaded these free resources, something brought you here.

Maybe you've been trying to break into federal contracting for years and nothing's worked. **(And you're exhausted.)**

Maybe you've taken courses, gotten registered, done "all the right things" - but you're still missing something. **(And you're frustrated.)**

Maybe you want to be a real federal contractor - not just someone who talks about it. **(And you're ready to prove it.)**

Maybe you're stuck in a job you hate and federal contracting is your way out. **(And you're hungry.)**

Maybe someone told you this wouldn't work, that you couldn't do it. **(And you want to prove them wrong.)**

Whatever brought you here... the question is the same:

**What are you going to do about it?**

Here's what Pro members are getting on January 31st:

✓ 8 hours of live, intensive training
✓ Personalized agency target list for YOUR business
✓ 3-5 matched opportunities you can pursue immediately
✓ Live capability statement reviews
✓ Teaming and subcontracting strategy session
✓ 90-day action plan
✓ Full recording access
✓ Searchable contract database access

The free resources I sent you are valuable. But they can't:

- Tell you which opportunities are right for YOUR specific business
- Review YOUR capability statement
- Answer YOUR specific questions
- Hold you accountable to actually take action

**That's what the bootcamp is for.**

5 days.

P.S. $99/month. Cancel anytime. But January 31st only happens once.

## EMAIL 11 - Day 11 (4 Days Left)
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** "I've been trying for 3 years..."

---

{{contact.first_name}},

I got an email last week that stopped me cold.

"I've been trying to break into government contracting for 3 years. I'm registered in SAM. I have my capability statement. I've been to industry days. I've applied to probably 50 opportunities.

I still haven't won anything.

I'm starting to think maybe this isn't for me."

My response:

**"It's not about you. It's about your strategy."**

Here's what I've seen after working with hundreds of small businesses:

The ones who fail aren't less capable. They're not less qualified. They don't work less hard.

They just do the wrong things:

❌ Target too many agencies (spread too thin)
❌ Send generic capability statements (look like everyone else)
❌ Wait for opportunities to come to them (reactive, not proactive)
❌ Send one email and give up (no follow-up)
❌ Try to figure it out alone (no accountability or feedback)

**The bootcamp fixes all five.**

In 8 hours, you'll walk away with:

✓ A focused list of 3-5 target agencies (not 50)
✓ Specific positioning for YOUR capabilities
✓ 3-5 opportunities to pursue THIS MONTH
✓ A teaming strategy with real prime contractors
✓ A 90-day action plan with weekly milestones
✓ A community that holds you accountable

If you've been trying for months or years... you don't need more information.

You need the right strategy and someone to help you execute it.

**4 days left.**

## EMAIL 12 - Day 12 (3 Days Left)
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** February 1st: Two different futures

---

{{contact.first_name}},

It's January 28th.

In 4 days, the bootcamp happens.

In 5 days, it's February.

Let me show you two versions of February 1st:

---

**VERSION A: You join the bootcamp**

You wake up on February 1st with:
- A list of 5 agencies perfectly matched to your business
- 3-5 specific opportunities you're already pursuing
- 5 prime contractors you're reaching out to for teaming
- A capability statement that's been reviewed and improved
- A week-by-week action plan for the next 90 days
- A community of other contractors doing the same thing

You're not wondering "what do I do next?" You KNOW.

When someone asks how your business is going, you say: "I'm pursuing 3 federal opportunities right now and in conversations with 2 prime contractors for teaming."

You feel like a federal contractor. Because you ARE one.

---

**VERSION B: You don't join**

You wake up on February 1st in the same place you are today.

Same questions. Same uncertainty. Same frustration.

You've got the free resources, sure. But they're sitting in a folder somewhere.

When someone asks how your business is going, you say: "Still working on it."

Still trying to figure it out alone. Still hoping something changes.

---

I'm not trying to pressure you.

I'm trying to show you what's possible.

**The bootcamp is in 3 days.**

Which version of February 1st do you want?

This is your moment → https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

Eric

---

## EMAIL 13 - Day 13 (48 Hours)
**Wait:** 1 day
**Subject:** Final call: 48 hours

---

{{contact.first_name}},

48 hours.

That's how long until the January 31st bootcamp.

I want to talk to a specific person right now.

**The one who's been doubted.**

Maybe it was a family member who asked when you're going to "get a real job."

Maybe it was a friend who said federal contracting is "too hard" or "not for people like us."

Maybe it was a former boss who made you feel small.

Maybe it was yourself - that voice in your head saying you're not qualified enough, not connected enough, not ready.

**Here's what I know:**

The people who win in this game aren't the most qualified. They're not the most connected. They're not the ones with the most resources.

They're the ones who refuse to quit.

They're the ones who get knocked down and get back up.

They're the ones who have something to prove.

**If that's you... January 31st is your day.**

8 hours. One intensive bootcamp. Everything you need to actually make this happen.

Not theory. Not motivation. A real plan with real action steps.

So that 90 days from now, when you win your first contract...

You'll know exactly who you're going to call first.

Join Pro and claim your spot → https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

$99/month. Cancel anytime.

But this opportunity doesn't come back.

Eric

P.S. If you have questions about whether this is right for you, reply to this email. I read every response.

## EMAIL 16 - Post-Bootcamp (Feb 1)
**Wait:** 1 day after bootcamp
**Subject:** You missed it... but there's still a way in

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Yesterday, we spent 8 hours with Pro members at the January Bootcamp.

Here's what they walked away with:
- Personalized agency target lists
- 3-5 matched opportunities they're pursuing THIS WEEK
- Reviewed capability statements
- Teaming strategies with specific prime contractors
- 90-day action plans

**You missed the live event.**

And I'm not going to pretend that doesn't matter. The live energy, the real-time Q&A, the capability statement reviews - that was a one-time experience.

**But here's what you didn't miss:**

If you join Pro today, you get:

✓ Full bootcamp recording (all 8 hours)
✓ All the worksheets and handouts
✓ Access to the searchable contract database
✓ Monthly training sessions
✓ Community support

The live experience is gone. But the transformation is still available.

**Here's the truth:**

The Q1 spending window is still open. February is just beginning. Agencies still have billions to spend.

The question is whether you're going to spend another month "trying"...

Or finally make it happen.

Join Pro and get the recording → https://federalhelpcenter.com/pro

Eric

P.S. The next live bootcamp isn't until April. If you want to take action in Q1, the recording is your best option.
