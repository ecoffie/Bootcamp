## Category 2: Small Business Goals & Set-Aside Requirements

### The Agency Pain Point

**Problem:** Federal agencies are legally required to meet small business contracting goals:
- **Federal Target:** 23% of contract dollars to small businesses
- **Subcategory Goals:** 
  - 5% to Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB)
  - 3% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)
  - 3% to HUBZone businesses
  - 5% to 8(a) businesses

**Why It's a Pain Point:**

Agencies consistently report the following challenges:

1. **"We struggle to find qualified small businesses"**
   - SBLOs report difficulty locating small businesses with the right capabilities
   - Small businesses aren't always registered in SAM.gov or other vendor databases
   - Agencies don't know where to look for qualified small business vendors
   - Limited visibility into small business capabilities

2. **"Matching capabilities is challenging"**
   - Hard to identify small businesses with specific technical expertise
   - Difficulty matching small business capabilities to mission requirements
   - Lack of clear capability statements from small businesses
   - Challenge connecting small business offerings to agency needs

3. **"Small businesses aren't registered or certified"**
   - Many small businesses aren't in SAM.gov
   - Missing certifications (8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone) that create set-aside opportunities
   - Incomplete vendor profiles in agency systems
   - Small businesses don't proactively reach out to agencies

4. **Agency Pressure Points:**
   - Pressure from Congress and OMB to meet 23% goal
   - Missing goals reflects poorly on agency leadership
   - Public reporting requirements
   - Audit scrutiny on small business contracting

5. **Prime Contractor Challenges:**
   - Large primes can't always meet all small business subcontracting goals
   - Difficulty finding small business subcontractors with required capabilities
   - Challenge matching prime contract requirements to small business capabilities

6. **NEW: 2026 NDAA Requirements (Signed December 18, 2025):**
   - **DoD must establish unified application process** - Streamlined small business registration (NEW MANDATE)
   - **Increased sole source thresholds** - $8M (non-manufacturing) and $10M (manufacturing) for set-asides (UP FROM $4.5M/$7M)
   - **Enhanced subcontracting transparency** - Primes must provide utilization plans; subcontractors can report issues (NEW REQUIREMENT)
   - **Cybersecurity harmonization** - DoD must harmonize cybersecurity requirements by June 1, 2026 (NEW DEADLINE)
   - **CMMC compliance support** - DoD must develop strategy by January 31, 2026 to help small businesses (NEW REQUIREMENT)
   - **Supply chain transparency database** - Online compliance database required by January 1, 2027 (NEW MANDATE)
