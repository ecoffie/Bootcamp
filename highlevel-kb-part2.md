# FINDING OPPORTUNITIES

## Where are federal contracts posted?
All federal contracts over $25,000 must be publicly posted on SAM.gov under Contract Opportunities. This is your primary source for federal opportunities.

## How do I find opportunities on SAM.gov?
Go to SAM.gov and look for Contract Opportunities. Search and filter by keywords, NAICS codes, set-aside type, agency, place of performance, and posted date. Save searches to get email alerts when new opportunities match.

## What about contracts under $25,000?
Smaller purchases—micro-purchases—don't have to be publicly posted. Agencies often use government credit cards or simplified procedures. Getting to know agency small business specialists helps you get on the radar for these.

## What's the difference between federal, state, and local opportunities?
Federal contracts are posted on SAM.gov, larger on average, more formal, nationwide. State contracts are on state-specific portals, vary in formality, regional. Local contracts are most fragmented with thousands of systems, often smaller but less competition.

## Should I focus on federal, state, or local contracting?
It depends on your business. Federal offers the biggest market if you can work anywhere. Local has less competition and easier relationship-building. Many successful contractors do both.

# WHY BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO FIND CONTRACTS

## Why can't I find government contracts?
Common reasons: not looking in the right places, using wrong keywords (government terminology differs from private sector), not checking regularly (opportunities have deadlines), searching too narrowly, or expecting opportunities to find you.

## I've been registered for months with no contracts. What's wrong?
Registration makes you visible—it doesn't bring contracts to you. You need to actively search for opportunities, respond to solicitations, and build relationships. The contracts go to businesses that pursue them.

## Why isn't registration enough?
SAM.gov registration is like having a phone number in a directory. People can find you if they look, but they won't look unless you give them a reason. You need to actively market, bid, and build relationships.

# BIDDING AND PROPOSALS

## How does bidding on government contracts work?
When you find an opportunity, you submit a bid (for commodity purchases where price is the main factor) or proposal (for services where they evaluate qualifications, approach, and price). The government evaluates responses and awards to the winner.

## How complicated are government proposals?
It varies widely. A simple purchase might need just a price quote. A large services contract might need 100+ pages with technical approach, past performance references, staffing plans, and detailed pricing. Start with smaller, simpler opportunities to learn.

## What makes a winning proposal?
The best proposals clearly demonstrate you understand what the agency needs, show relevant experience and capability, offer competitive pricing, and comply with all requirements. Many businesses miss basic requirements or don't communicate qualifications effectively.

# MULTIPLE BUSINESS IDEAS

## I have multiple business ideas. How do I know which one to pursue for government contracting?
Great question—and you're smart to think about this before diving in. The best approach is to let the data guide you. We have a free tool called Opportunity Hunter that shows you which agencies spend the most money in different industries. That way you can see where the real demand is before you commit to a direction.

## I have two businesses. Which one should I register for government contracting?
Rather than guessing, use our free Opportunity Hunter tool at {{OpportunityHunterLink}}. It shows you actual government spending by agency and industry. You might discover one of your businesses aligns with billions in annual spending while the other has limited opportunities. Let the numbers guide your decision.

## How do I decide which business idea has the best chance with government contracts?
Start with research, not assumptions. Our Opportunity Hunter tool is free and shows you which agencies are spending money and in what categories. You might think one idea is stronger, but the data could surprise you. It takes just a few minutes and could save you months of pursuing the wrong path.

## Can I register multiple businesses for government contracting?
Yes, you can register each business separately in SAM.gov. But if you're just starting out, I'd recommend focusing on one first. Use our free Opportunity Hunter tool to see which business aligns with the most government spending, then build your foundation there before expanding.

## What's the Opportunity Hunter tool?
Opportunity Hunter is a free tool we offer that lets you research government spending by agency and industry. It shows you where the money actually flows—so instead of guessing whether there's demand for your services, you can see real numbers. It's the first step we recommend for anyone trying to decide which direction to take.

## How does Opportunity Hunter work?
You enter your industry or service type, and it shows you which federal agencies spend money in that area and how much. You can compare different industries side by side. It's completely free and takes just a few minutes. Think of it as market research for government contracting.

## Where can I access Opportunity Hunter?
You can access it for free at {{OpportunityHunterLink}}. No registration required—just start exploring spending data right away.

## Is it better to be a generalist or specialist in government contracting?
Generally, specialists win more. Agencies want to hire experts, not jacks-of-all-trades. But which specialty? Use Opportunity Hunter to find niches with strong spending. A specialized business in a high-demand area beats a generalist trying to do everything.

# ERIC COFFIE'S 5-PHASE ACTION PLAN

## What's the recommended process for getting into government contracting?
Eric Coffie recommends a 5-phase approach: Phase 1 is Setup (do once), Phase 2 is Bidding (repeat), Phase 3 is Business Development (repeat), Phase 4 is Business Enhancement (do once), and Phase 5 is Contract Management. Most beginners should focus on completing Phase 1 before moving on.

## What is Phase 1 - Setup?
Phase 1 is your foundation—you do this once to get properly registered and positioned. The steps are: 1) Choose your business structure (supplier vs. service provider vs. consultant), 2) Get your UEI number, 3) Create a professional email, 4) Identify your NAICS codes, 5) Create your SAM.gov profile, 6) Register for local government sites, 7) Talk to your local APEX Accelerator, 8) Create or fix your capability statement.

## How do I choose my business structure?
Decide if you're a supplier (selling products), service provider (delivering services like IT, janitorial, security), or consultant (providing expertise and advice). This affects your NAICS codes, the opportunities you pursue, and how you position yourself. Each has different requirements and contract types.

## What's a UEI and how do I get one?
UEI stands for Unique Entity Identifier. It replaced the old DUNS number. You get it free through SAM.gov when you start your registration. It's required before you can complete your SAM profile.

## Why do I need a professional email?
A professional email (yourname@yourbusiness.com) looks more credible than a Gmail or Yahoo address when dealing with government buyers. It signals you're a legitimate business, not a hobby.

## How do I identify my NAICS codes?
NAICS codes classify what type of work you do. Search the Census Bureau's NAICS lookup tool or Google your service type plus "NAICS code." Most businesses have 3-10 codes. Pick codes that honestly represent work you can perform—don't overreach, but don't be too narrow either.

## How do I create a SAM.gov profile?
Go to SAM.gov and start the entity registration process. You'll need your UEI, business information, banking details, NAICS codes, and company officer information. Take your time—errors cause delays. The process takes 2-4 weeks if done correctly.

## What's DSBS?
DSBS is the Dynamic Small Business Search—a database within SAM.gov where contracting officers search for small businesses. Once your SAM registration is complete, your business appears in DSBS. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling.

## What's an APEX Accelerator?
APEX Accelerators (formerly called PTACs) are free government-funded counseling centers that help small businesses with government contracting. They provide free one-on-one counseling, training, and assistance with registration and certifications. Every state has them—find your local one and schedule a meeting.

## What should I say to my APEX Accelerator counselor?
Tell them: what your business does, that you're interested in government contracting, where you are in the process (registered or not), and what help you need. They can review your SAM profile, help with your capability statement, point you to opportunities, and guide your certification strategy. It's free—use them.

## What's a capability statement?
A capability statement is your business resume—a one or two-page document that tells government buyers who you are, what you do, your past performance, differentiators, certifications, and contact information. You need one before meeting with buyers or attending events. Make sure it clearly shows what makes you different from competitors.

## What should be on my capability statement?
Include: company name and logo, core competencies (what you do), differentiators (what makes you unique), past performance (relevant work you've done), NAICS codes, certifications and set-asides, UEI and CAGE code, and contact information. Keep it clean, professional, and focused on what buyers care about.

## What is Phase 2 - Bidding?
Phase 2 is where you actually pursue opportunities. This is a repeating cycle: 1) Review immediate bid opportunities, 2) Assemble your team based on the opportunity, 3) Apply for vendor/supplier credit if needed, 4) Respond to the opportunity (RFP, RFQ, RFI, or Task Order), 5) Evaluate your bid results and learn from wins and losses.

## How do I find bid opportunities?
Search SAM.gov Contract Opportunities filtered by your NAICS codes and set-asides. But remember—SAM.gov only shows about 5% of opportunities. Use Opportunity Hunter to find which agencies spend in your space, then dig into IDIQ task orders, GSA schedules, and agency-specific portals for the other 95%.

## What's the difference between RFP, RFQ, and RFI?
RFP (Request for Proposal) asks for a detailed proposal including technical approach and pricing—used for complex services. RFQ (Request for Quotation) asks for pricing on specific items—used for simpler purchases. RFI (Request for Information) is the government gathering info before an actual solicitation—respond to these to get on their radar.

## Should I bid on everything I find?
No. Use a bid/no-bid framework to qualify opportunities. Consider: Do you meet all requirements? Do you have relevant past performance? Can you compete on price? Do you have or can you assemble the right team? Is the timeline realistic? Bidding on everything wastes resources and produces weak proposals.

## What is Phase 3 - Business Development?
Phase 3 is proactive relationship building and opportunity hunting—not just waiting for things to appear on SAM.gov. Steps: 1) Identify your top 25 buyers and future bids, 2) Set up and attend meetings with government buyers, 3) Attend industry events, 4) Attend site visits, 5) Get on supplier lists for top 25 federal prime contractors, 6) Monitor contract awards and identify subcontracting opportunities, 7) Track long-term IDIQ contracts to bid on.

## What do you mean by "Top 25 Buyers"?
These are the 25 agencies, offices, or prime contractors most likely to buy what you sell. Use Opportunity Hunter and spending data to identify who's actually spending money in your NAICS codes. Then focus your business development on building relationships with those specific buyers rather than spraying and praying.

## Why are industry events important?
Industry events let you meet contracting officers, prime contractors, and potential teaming partners face-to-face. Many contracts are influenced by relationships built before the solicitation drops. Events include agency industry days, small business conferences, and matchmaking sessions.

## What's a site visit?
Some agencies hold site visits where potential contractors can see the work location and ask questions before bidding. Attending shows you're serious and gives you information competitors who skip it won't have.

## How do I get on prime contractor supplier lists?
Contact the Small Business Liaison Officers (SBLOs) at large prime contractors. Tell them your capabilities, certifications, and NAICS codes. Primes need small business subcontractors to meet their contractual goals—position yourself as a solution to their problem.

## What is Phase 4 - Business Enhancement?
Phase 4 is about leveling up once you have your foundation and some experience. Steps: 1) Apply for small business certifications, 2) Pursue 8(a) certification if eligible, 3) Explore Mentor-Protégé programs, 4) Focus on self-performance capability as a differentiator, 5) Find better partners, 6) Identify a mid-size mentor, 7) Speak at an event to build credibility.

## When should I pursue certifications?
After you have Phase 1 complete and ideally some bidding experience from Phase 2. Certifications open doors to set-asides, but they don't help if you don't have the foundation to compete. Don't chase certifications before you're ready to use them.

## What's a Mentor-Protégé program?
Mentor-Protégé programs pair small businesses with larger, experienced contractors who provide guidance, training, and sometimes joint venture opportunities. SBA has a federal program; many agencies and primes have their own. It's a way to build capability and access larger contracts.

## Why focus on self-performance capability?
As you grow, being able to self-perform work (rather than subbing everything out) becomes a competitive advantage. Agencies increasingly want to see that you can actually do the work, not just manage subcontractors. Build real capability over time.

## Why should I speak at an event?
Speaking positions you as an expert, builds credibility, and creates visibility with potential buyers and partners. It's business development that scales—one presentation reaches many people.

## What is Phase 5 - Contract Management?
Phase 5 kicks in after you win contracts. It's about delivering successfully and staying compliant. Steps: 1) Complete system registrations (PIEE, WAWF), 2) Manage subcontractor compliance, 3) Handle project compliance, 4) Maintain communication with the contracting officer.

## What's PIEE?
PIEE (Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment) is the DoD system for contract administration. If you win a DoD contract, you'll need to register and use PIEE for various administrative functions.

## What's WAWF?
WAWF (Wide Area Workflow) is how you submit invoices for payment on many government contracts, especially DoD. You must be registered and know how to use it to get paid.

## Why is communication important in contract management?
Proactive communication with your contracting officer prevents small issues from becoming big problems. Report progress, flag issues early, and document everything. A well-managed contract leads to strong past performance ratings, which help you win future contracts.

## Which phase should I start with?
Start with Phase 1 - Setup. Don't skip ahead. Many people try to jump straight to bidding without having their foundation in place, and they waste time on opportunities they're not positioned to win. Complete Phase 1 first, then cycle through Phase 2 (Bidding) and Phase 3 (Business Development) repeatedly as you grow.

## How long does Phase 1 take?
If you focus, you can complete Phase 1 in 30-60 days. SAM.gov registration takes 2-4 weeks. Creating your capability statement takes a few days. Scheduling an APEX meeting takes a week or two. The key is not to get stuck—keep moving through the steps.

## Can I do Phase 2 and Phase 3 at the same time?
Yes, and you should. Bidding (Phase 2) and Business Development (Phase 3) work together. While you're responding to immediate opportunities, you're also building relationships for future opportunities. Most successful contractors run both continuously.

# RESULTS AND PRICING

## What results can I expect?
Within 90 days, clients are typically fully registered in SAM.gov, clear on certifications to pursue, equipped with target opportunities, and actively bidding. Within 6-12 months, many have their first contract or subcontract.

## What don't you promise?
We don't promise specific contract values or guarantee wins. Anyone who guarantees that isn't being honest. We guarantee you'll be properly set up and equipped to compete.

## How is pricing structured?
Pricing depends on services needed: registration assistance is a flat fee, certification support is per-certification, opportunity identification can be monthly or project-based, and proposal support varies by complexity. Comprehensive packages offer bundled rates.

## Is there a monthly fee?
Depends on service level. One-time services like registration are flat fees. Ongoing services like opportunity identification or proposal support are typically monthly. We structure it based on what makes sense for your business.
