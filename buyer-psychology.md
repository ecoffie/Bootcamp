# Stop Looking at Demographics. Start Looking at Psychological State

There are only 5 types of people who actually buy shit online. Everyone else is just window shopping.

Once you understand this you'll never struggle to sell anything again...

There are 5 types of buyers who actually open wallets and once you understand this you'll print forever while everyone else fights over scraps.

## 1. Rock Bottom Buyer

Just went through some shit. Breakup. Got fired. Health scare. Public humiliation.

Their identity shattered and they're desperate as fuck to rebuild into someone new.

These mfs will buy anything that promises transformation:
- Fitness
- Dating  
- Money
- Spirituality

Doesn't matter. They're not buying info. They're buying a new identity to escape the old one.

You find them in comment sections at 2am. Reddit posts about "starting over." Tweets about life falling apart.

Conversion rate is stupid high bc they NEED to take action to feel like they're fixing themselves.

**Easy to kill.**

## 2. Almost There Buyer

Already tried everything. Courses. Coaches. Books. YouTube rabbitholes.

Not a beginner. Spent thousands already. Knows the basics.

What they want is the "missing piece" that finally clicks.

These buyers are goldmines bc they've proven they spend money. Just need to believe you have what they haven't tried yet.

You find them asking specific questions in communities:
- "Has anyone tried X method?"
- "What's actually working in 2025?"

Position your shit as "what the gurus don't teach" and they purchase same day.

**Soft as a cookie for the right offer.**

## 3. Identity Buyer

Doesn't actually want results. Wants to FEEL like the type of person who buys this type shit.

- Buying a trading course = "I'm a trader now"
- Buying a fitness program = "I'm an athlete" 
- Joining a mastermind = "I'm an entrepreneur"

These mfs buy repeatedly and never open the content. They just want the label.

Why communities print so hard. They're paying for the identity of being "in the room."

You find them flexing purchases in comments. Posting screenshots of courses. Talking about what they're "working on."

Retention is insane bc leaving = giving up the identity.

## 4. Escape Buyer

Hates their current life. Job. City. Relationship. Whatever.

No specific goal. Just wants OUT.

Anything promising freedom converts stupid well:
- Remote work
- Passive income
- Location independence
- "Fire your boss"

Not buying a business model. Buying a fantasy of a different life.

Will pay premium for anything that feels like a way out.

You find them posting about hating Mondays. Commenting "this is the dream" on lifestyle content. Asking "how do I start" on every money tweet.

**Sell the destination not the vehicle.**

**Easy to kill.**

## 5. Revenge Buyer

Wants to prove someone wrong. Ex. Parents. Old boss. That one mf from high school.

Not motivated by success. Motivated by making someone feel stupid for doubting them.

These buyers are aggressive as fuck. Work harder than anyone bc it's personal.

Will pay more bc the purchase itself is part of the revenge.

"I invested in myself while you stayed average."

You find them posting about people who wronged them. "Can't wait to show them" type shit.

Lean into revenge angle and they throw money at you.

## The Mistake?

Most low iq retards try selling to "everyone."

Everyone doesn't buy. Only people in these 5 psychological states buy.

Stop writing generic goyslop copy about "results" and "value."

Start writing copy that makes someone in crisis feel like you're reading their fucking mind.

**Fish where people are already reaching for wallets.**

This is why I print while others beg for sales.

**Study.**
