## The 3 hook frameworks applied to this topic

### 1) **Value + Gift + Consequence**
**"I'm giving away $1,500 worth of secrets tonight — but only if you stay."**
Why it works: perceived value + urgency + FOMO.

### 2) **Proof-led claim**
**"These are the exact strategies from an 8-hour bootcamp — condensed into 45 minutes."**
Why it works: credibility + reduces "is this worth my time?"

### 3) **Path to action**
**"By the end of this live, you'll have 5 strategies and one action to take tonight."**
Why it works: clear outcome + reduces "so what?"

## Opening Hook (First 60 Seconds) — CRITICAL

**Say this IMMEDIATELY when you go live:**

> "What's good everybody — welcome to the live!
>
> On Friday, we did an **8-hour bootcamp**. People paid to be in that room. Tonight? I'm giving you the highlights — **$1,500 worth of strategies** — for free.
>
> Here's the deal: I'm about to share the **5 strategies** that are actually getting contractors positioned for contracts in 2026. Not theory. Not 'maybe this works.' These are the exact frameworks we walked through at the bootcamp.
>
> If you weren't there, this is your second chance. If you WERE there, this is your review session.
>
> Drop where you're watching from in the chat. Like the video. And let's get into it — because by the end of this, you're going to have a game plan for Q1."

---

## Retention Beats (Use These to Keep Viewers)

Use these to prevent drop-off:

- **Minute 2:** "In 60 seconds I'll show you the 5 inputs that change your entire targeting strategy — don't leave yet."
- **Before Sources Sought:** "This next stat is going to blow your mind — less than 5% of contractors know this."
- **Before expiring contracts:** "This strategy alone has helped contractors position for millions — stay with me."
- **Before Q&A:** "Drop your questions in chat — I'm going to answer the most common ones live."
- **Before the offer:** "Everything I just taught you? There's a shortcut. Let me show you."

## Slide-by-Slide Talking Points

### SLIDE 1: Title Slide
*Don't stay long — 10 seconds max*
> "January Bootcamp Recap. $1,500 worth of strategies. Let's go."

---

### SLIDE 2: What We Covered at the Bootcamp
**Stats: 8 Hours | 5 Core Steps | AI Market Research | 4 Premium Tools**

> "Look at these numbers. 8 hours of live training. 5 core steps we walked through. AI prompts for market research that cut your research time by 10x. And 4 premium tools that do the heavy lifting.
>
> But I can't cover 8 hours in 45 minutes. So tonight, I'm giving you the **TOP 5 strategies** — the ones that move the needle fastest.
>
> Take just ONE of these and execute this week? You'll be ahead of 90% of contractors out there."

**Retention beat:** "Strategy #1 is the one most people get wrong — and it's costing them contracts."

---

### SLIDE 3: Strategy #1 — Target Like a Sniper

> "Strategy #1: Stop spraying and praying. Start TARGETING.
>
> Here's what I see constantly — contractors on SAM.gov every day, applying to everything. That's a LOSING strategy. You're competing against everybody. Spreading yourself thin.
>
> The contractors who are actually winning? They pick their agencies. They pick their opportunities. They FOCUS.
>
> I'm about to show you exactly how they do it."

---

### SLIDE 4: The 5 Inputs That Change Everything

> "Write these down. Seriously — pause and write these down.
>
> **1. Your certifications** — 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone. This determines your set-asides.
>
> **2. Your ZIP code** — Some agencies have local preference. Some contracts require geographic presence.
>
> **3. Your PSC codes** — Product and Service Codes. What you DO.
>
> **4. Your NAICS codes** — Your industry classification.
>
> **5. Your target agencies** — Not every agency. Not 10. Your TOP 3.
>
> This is your targeting foundation. Everything else builds on this."

**Retention beat:** "Most contractors skip this step — that's why they're losing."

---

### SLIDE 5: Strategy #2 — Agency Pain Points

> "Strategy #2: Understand their pain points.
>
> These 8 things keep contracting officers up at night:
>
> 1. **Meeting small business goals** — they get GRADED on this
> 2. **Finding specialized capabilities**
> 3. **Past performance verification**
> 4. **Geographic coverage**
> 5. **Security clearances**
> 6. **Quick-turn requirements**
> 7. **Budget uncertainty**
> 8. **Staffing turnover**
>
> Here's what this means: They NEED you. They're REQUIRED to spend with small businesses. The problem isn't that they don't want to work with you — they can't FIND you."

---

### SLIDE 6: Don't Sell Services. Solve Problems.

> "Read this slide. Let it sink in.
>
> Don't sell services. Solve PROBLEMS.
>
> Most capability statements are all about the contractor. 'We do this, we do that, we've been in business 20 years...'
>
> Nobody cares.
>
> Your capability statement should speak to THEIR challenges, not YOUR features.
>
> Instead of 'We provide IT services' — say 'We help agencies meet their small business IT goals while maintaining security compliance.'
>
> See the difference?"

---

### SLIDE 7: Strategy #3 — AI for Market Research

> "Strategy #3: Use AI for market research.
>
> Here's the truth: AI won't replace you. But contractors USING AI will replace contractors who don't.
>
> At the bootcamp, we showed exactly how to use AI to find agency pain points and do market research 10x faster.
>
> **Find Agency Pain Points:** 'Research [Agency] and identify their top pain points for FY2026'
>
> **Match NAICS to Needs:** 'What problems is [Agency] solving with NAICS [Code]?'
>
> **Analyze Spending:** 'Show me [Agency]'s spending trends and top contractors'
>
> What used to take a full day of research now takes 5 minutes. That's the advantage."

---

### SLIDE 8: Strategy #4 — The Hit List Method

> "Strategy #4: The Hit List Method.
>
> Stop scrolling random SAM.gov results. That's gambling, not strategy.
>
> **Step 1:** Filter by your NAICS codes.
>
> **Step 2:** Cross-reference with your target agencies.
>
> **Step 3:** Score by competition level. Fewer bidders = better odds.
>
> The formula: **Low competition + Right NAICS + Target Agency = High probability win.**"

**Retention beat:** "But here's a secret most contractors don't know..."

---

### SLIDE 9: The Sources Sought Secret

> "Look at this number. **Less than 5%.**
>
> Less than 5% of contractors respond to Sources Sought notices.
>
> If you respond, you're AUTOMATICALLY in the top 5%. Just by showing up.
>
> But it gets better — when you respond, you can INFLUENCE how the agency writes the final requirement. You're shaping the opportunity before it drops.
>
> This week: Find ONE Sources Sought in your NAICS. Respond. That's it. One response puts you ahead of 95% of your competition."

---

### SLIDE 10: Strategy #5 — Expiring Contracts

> "Strategy #5: Expiring contracts.
>
> The fastest path to a contract isn't chasing new opportunities. It's positioning on recompetes.
>
> **Path A: Team WITH the incumbent.** They need small business subs. Lower risk. Build past performance.
>
> **Path B: Compete AGAINST.** Position as the better option. Higher risk, higher reward.
>
> The sweet spot? **12-18 months before expiration.** That's when agencies start market research. That's when incumbents build teams.
>
> If you wait for the RFP, you're already too late."

---

### SLIDE 11: Your Challenge This Week

> "Here's my challenge. Pick ONE:
>
> 1. **Pick your 3 target agencies** — write them down TONIGHT
> 2. **Respond to one Sources Sought** — get on an agency's radar
> 3. **Find 3 expiring contracts** — USASpending.gov, add to your pipeline
> 4. **Research one agency with AI** — know their spending before outreach
>
> One action. That's all it takes to build momentum.
>
> Drop in chat which one you're doing."

---

### SLIDE 12: Q&A Time

> "Q&A time. Drop questions in chat.
>
> Common ones:
>
> **'How do I find contracting officers?'** — FPDS, USASpending, agency OSDBU offices.
>
> **'Do I need past performance?'** — Not for micro-purchases under $10K. Commercial experience counts.
>
> **'How do I team with primes?'** — Don't just ask to team. Bring VALUE. Know their contracts.
>
> **'Is 8(a) worth it?'** — Absolutely. Sole-source up to $4.5M services, $7M manufacturing.
>
> Who's registered on SAM.gov? Drop a checkmark."

*[Answer live questions 5-10 minutes]*

### SLIDE 13: Want to Shortcut All of This?

> "Everything I just taught you? There are tools that do the heavy lifting FOR you.
>
> Why spend weeks doing manually what you can do in minutes with the right tools?"

---

### SLIDE 14: The Ultimate Giant Bundle

> "The Ultimate Giant Bundle. Four premium tools:
>
> **Market Assassin Premium** — Enter your 5 inputs, get 8 detailed reports automatically.
>
> **Federal Contractor Database** — 200+ SBLO contacts with emails and phone numbers.

>

>
> These tools turn weeks of work into minutes."

>
> Ultimate Giant Bundle — all four tools — normally $1,500.
>
> Watching live right now? **$1,000.** That's $500 off.
