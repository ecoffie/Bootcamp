## EMAIL 2: QUICK WIN - THE TIER 2 SECRET (Day 1)

**Subject:** Why 97% of small businesses target the WRONG contractors

**Body:**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Here's a secret most GovCon "gurus" won't tell you:

**The biggest contractors are NOT your best opportunity.**

Everyone targets the Lockheed Martins and Boeings of the world. That's a mistake.

Here's why:

**Tier 1 (Major Primes):**
- 12-18 months to first contract
- 2-5% success rate
- Hundreds of competitors
- SBLOs get 50-100 emails per WEEK

**Tier 2 (Mid-Tier Subcontractors):**
- 3-6 months to first contract
- 30-45% success rate
- Dozens of competitors (not hundreds)
- SBLOs actually respond

That's a **10-15x higher success rate** with Tier 2 companies.

Why? Because most small businesses overlook them.

Look through your **Subcontractor Directory** download. These are your fastest path to revenue.

**Real numbers from your downloads:**
- Tier 2 email response rate: 60-80%
- Tier 1 email response rate: 10-20%

Start with Tier 2. Build credibility. Then graduate to Tier 1.

Tomorrow I'll show you exactly what to say when you reach out.

Eric

## EMAIL 3: VALUE - HOW TO USE THE CONTACT DIRECTORY (Day 2)

**Subject:** Copy this email template (73% response rate)

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

Yesterday I showed you why Tier 2 contractors are your best opportunity.

Today, here's exactly what to say when you reach out:

---

**SUBJECT:** Quick question about [AGENCY NAME] small business needs

Hi [SBLO NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] has significant work with [AGENCY]. My company specializes in [YOUR NAICS/CAPABILITY] and we're exploring teaming opportunities.

We're [YOUR SMALL BUSINESS CERTIFICATION] certified and have experience in [BRIEF RELEVANT EXPERIENCE].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR COMPANY]

---

**Why this works:**

1. **Specific** - References their actual agency relationships
2. **Brief** - SBLOs are busy, respect their time
3. **Clear ask** - 15 minutes, not a vague "let's connect"

Open your **Prime Contractor Contact Directory** right now.

Pick 5 companies that work with agencies in your NAICS code. Send this email template to each one.

That's your homework for today.

Talk tomorrow,

Eric

P.S. Finding the right contractors manually takes HOURS. The Federal Contractor Database lets you filter by NAICS, agency, and contract size instantly. [See how it works →]

## EMAIL 4: VALUE - 2026 EXPIRING CONTRACTS (Day 3)

**Subject:** $430 BILLION in contracts expiring soon

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

Here's something most contractors miss:

When a federal contract expires, the agency MUST find a new contractor (or re-compete the existing one).

This creates a massive window of opportunity.

Your **2026 Expiring Contracts** download shows you exactly which contracts are ending. These are agencies that will be buying SOON.

**Here's how to use it:**

1. Find contracts in your NAICS code
2. Identify the current prime contractor
3. Reach out to BECOME their subcontractor for the re-compete
4. Or position yourself for the new competition

The primes bidding on re-competes NEED small business partners to meet their subcontracting goals.

Your timing couldn't be better. Agencies are planning their 2026 acquisitions RIGHT NOW.

Action step: Open your **2026 Expiring Contracts** download. Find 3 contracts in your industry. Research the current primes.

Tomorrow I'll show you how the December Spend Forecast creates URGENT buying opportunities.

Eric

P.S. Want to instantly see which of the 3,502 federal prime contractors work in YOUR specific NAICS codes? [The Federal Contractor Database makes it easy →]

## EMAIL 5: VALUE - DECEMBER SPEND FORECAST (Day 4)

**Subject:** Agencies are DESPERATE to spend right now (here's why)

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

Quick government finance lesson:

Federal agencies operate on a "use it or lose it" budget.

If they don't spend their allocated budget by end of fiscal year, they get LESS money next year.

Result? Agencies go on a spending spree in Q4 (and especially December).

This is called the "spend forecast" - and it's pure gold for contractors.

Your **December Spend Forecast** download shows you:
- Which agencies have money to spend
- What they're buying
- How much they need to obligate

**Why this matters for subcontracting:**

Prime contractors need to meet their small business subcontracting goals too. When agencies push contracts through fast, primes need partners FAST.

This is when response times go from "2-4 weeks" to "can you start Monday?"

Open your December Spend Forecast. Cross-reference with your Prime Contractor Directory.

Target the primes working with agencies that have Q4 spending pressure.

Tomorrow: How to use the Beginner Contracts list to find your first win.

Eric

P.S. Imagine filtering 3,502+ contractors by the EXACT agencies in your spend forecast. The Federal Contractor Database does exactly that. [Take a look →]

---

## EMAIL 6: VALUE - BEGINNER CONTRACTS (Day 5)

**Subject:** These contracts have almost NO competition

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

One of the biggest barriers to federal work is "past performance."

Agencies want to see you've done this before. But how do you get experience without experience?

Enter: **Low Competition / Beginner Contracts**

Your download shows opportunities specifically suited for companies breaking in:

- Lower dollar values (easier to win)
- Fewer competitors
- Simpler requirements
- Agencies that actively WANT new vendors

These aren't sexy $50M contracts. They're $50K-$500K opportunities that build your track record.

**Strategy:**

1. Use beginner contracts to build past performance
2. Use that credibility to land larger subcontracts
3. Graduate to Tier 1 prime relationships

The companies that win big started small. Every major GovCon player has a story about their first $50K contract.

What's yours going to be?

Tomorrow I'll share how the 75 AI Prompts can accelerate your research 10x.

Eric

P.S. 97.8% of Tier 2 contractors DON'T have formal vendor portals - meaning you can reach their SBLOs directly. [See them all in the Federal Contractor Database →]

## EMAIL 7: DATABASE PITCH (Day 6)

**Subject:** Here's what took us 6 months to build

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

I need to tell you about something we built.

For 6 months, our team researched, compiled, and verified every federal prime contractor with active subcontracting plans.

The result: **The Federal Contractor Database**

**What's inside:**

- **3,502 federal prime contractors** (not random companies - verified primes with SBA subcontracting plans)
- **800+ SBLO contacts** with emails and phone numbers
- **115+ supplier portal links** (know exactly where to register)
- **Filter by NAICS** - find contractors in YOUR industry
- **Filter by agency** - target specific government clients
- **Filter by contract size** - from $50K to $30B+
- **Export to CSV** - for your outreach campaigns

**Why this matters:**

Your free downloads are great for learning the landscape.

But when you're ready to actually START reaching out? You need volume. You need precision. You need efficiency.

Manually researching contractors takes 10-15 hours per week.

The database does it in seconds.

**One-time investment:** ~~$1,997~~ **$497** (Lifetime access)

[GET THE FEDERAL CONTRACTOR DATABASE →]

This isn't a subscription. Pay once, access forever.

Tomorrow I'll share how our members are using the 75 AI prompts to 10x their research.

Eric

P.S. Over 97% of the Tier 2 contractors have NO formal vendor portal. That means direct SBLO contact is your only option. The database gives you those contacts instantly.

---

## EMAIL 8: VALUE - AI PROMPTS (Day 7)

**Subject:** 75 prompts that do your research FOR you

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

Let me share a game-changer.

Your **75 GovCon AI Prompts** download is one of the most overlooked resources in your bundle.

Here's how to use them:

**For Company Research:**
- "Analyze [COMPANY]'s federal contract history and identify their small business subcontracting needs"
- "Find pain points for [AGENCY] that a [YOUR CAPABILITY] company could solve"

**For Outreach:**
- "Write a cold email to an SBLO at [COMPANY] for a company specializing in [YOUR NAICS]"
- "Create 5 follow-up touchpoints for a prime contractor who hasn't responded"

**For Proposals:**
- "Summarize the key requirements from this RFP..."
- "Identify discriminators that would make a small business stand out for this opportunity"

These prompts turn hours of research into minutes.

The AI does the heavy lifting. You make the decisions.

Combine these prompts with the contractor data in your downloads (or the full database) and you've got a research machine.

Tomorrow: The 2026 Action Plan breakdown.

Eric

P.S. Research is only as good as your data. The Federal Contractor Database gives you 3,502 contractors to run these prompts against. [Get instant access →]

## EMAIL 9: VALUE + URGENCY (Day 8)

**Subject:** Your 2026 GovCon Action Plan (step by step)

**Body:**

{{contact.first_name}},

Let's get tactical.

Your **2026 Action Plan** download breaks down exactly what to do each month. But here's the summary:

**Q1 (January-March): Foundation**
- Identify your top 20 target contractors
- Register in their supplier portals
- Send initial outreach to SBLOs
- Goal: 5-10 conversations started

**Q2 (April-June): Momentum**
- Follow up on Q1 contacts
- Expand to 30-40 targets
- Submit capability statements
- Goal: 2-3 teaming discussions

**Q3 (July-September): Acceleration**
- Q4 spending pressure begins
- Primes need partners for year-end push
- Proposal season heats up
- Goal: 1-2 active proposals

**Q4 (October-December): Harvest**
- Maximum buying activity
- Contract awards accelerate
- Position for next FY
- Goal: First contract or LOI

**The key?** Starting Q1 with the RIGHT targets.

That's where most people fail. They spend months researching the wrong companies.

The Federal Contractor Database eliminates that problem. Filter by your NAICS. Find your targets. Start outreach in days, not months.

Tomorrow: One final resource for you.
