## Key Findings

### Portal Statistics (Updated):
- **Companies with Full Portals:** 1 (2.2%)
  - KPMG: https://kpmg.supplierone.co/

- **Companies Requiring SBLO Contact:** 45 (97.8%)

### This Confirms:
The Tier 2 go-to-market strategy is **relationship-based**, not portal-based:
- ✅ Direct SBLO relationships are critical
- ✅ Personal connections matter more than portals
- ✅ Faster response times compared to Tier 1
- ✅ Less competition than formal portal systems
- ✅ More agile procurement processes
