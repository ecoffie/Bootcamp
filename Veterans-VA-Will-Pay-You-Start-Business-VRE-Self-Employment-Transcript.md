**(00:00)** So, you keep hearing you should use your GI Bill to go back to school, right? Well, that's why you're stuck. What if instead of another degree, the VA would pay you for your business certifications, your LLC, your laptop, and even give you a monthly stipend while you learn how to win government contracts.

**(00:15)** You were able to get some of those services paid for or reimbursed by the VA hospital.

**Rafa:** I got paid to take training. I got paid to do my LLC and my certifications.

One veteran was told no the first time she applied, but then she found a specific chapter in the VA regulations most counselors don't even talk about. Today, two veterans who got the VA to fund their entire startup reveal the exact track you need to ask for and the one phrase that gets you a yes.

**(00:39)** What would be the first step for someone? Where should they start?

**Rafa:** The first step is the contract.

Rafa, if you want to introduce yourself.

**Rafa:** My name is Rafa Gibbird. I'm the owner of Brave One Contract Agency and I have created the business with a focus on construction for the federal government.

Okay. And Renona.

**(01:01)** **Renona:** Hi Eric. Thanks for having me. My name is Renona Riddle Brown and I'm the CEO and founder of Hermar Solutions and I my main market is going to be the federal government sector as well as private sector and I'm in the startup phase of my business at this point.

Okay. And the point, the reason why I wanted to have you on today was because in knowing your two stories, I was familiar that you were able to get some of those services paid for or reimbursed by the VA hospital. And so that was the idea like, let me come on and help you share that so that you can maybe give someone an idea of what's available and then also be kind of like a testimony to the fact that the government does have programs out there to help people who want to pursue these respective avenues.

**(01:45)** Would you say that's the case for Nona in your situation?

**Renona:** Yes. For me, what initially happened was I was working for after I retired from the military, I went and continued my service for the federal government sector. I worked at Social Security Administration. Then I went on to the VA and then I went on to CBP, Customs and Border Protection. And while doing that, I got sick. I'm already a service disabled veteran, but my disabilities were exasperated through the duties the things that I was performing as a federal government employee and as a branch chief. And so, you know, I felt like I had so much to offer, you know, to the world and also wanted to have that quality of life for myself to feel that I'm giving back.

**(02:28)** And so, I learned about the self-employment track. And I actually applied for the self-employment track when I was at the VA. I was still working and I was disapproved. And the self-employment track by the way is under the vocational rehabilitation program.

**(02:48)** Can you pull up those tracks please share on the screen for folks to see. Go ahead. You can keep talking.

**Renona:** Okay. Right. And so most veterans are aware of the first three tracks which are all educational tracks but many actually pursue the self-employment track and the living track. And so you know I wanted to do continue to do something. you know, after I was retired on disability from the federal government and actually had my business idea back in 2005 when I initially retired. And so I was, you know, learned about the different programs that were available through vocational rehabilitation. And that's when I learned about the self-employment track maybe a few years before I retired. And so I applied for self-employment track. The first time I didn't do it right. The second time, you know, I did my homework, read the regulations, looked at different resources, and I was more prepared when I went in to apply for self-employment and I was approved.

**(03:35)** Can you guys one of you give me a high-level overview of because you mentioned a couple different tracks. You said vocational rehab and then you said self-employment. What's the difference?

**Rafa:** Actually vocational rehabilitation is one of the branches of the Veterans Affairs and what they help with is they try to help veterans reintegrate into the workforce. They look at reemployment, rapid access to employment, self-employment, employment through long-term services and independent living. So those are the five tracks and I think most veterans are familiar with going back to school and getting a degree or getting some kind of certification.

**(04:17)** Okay. So what did you in your particular case Rafa what did you do different than to go back to school and get the education because from what I understand most people do like a master's degree or they do like a formal education.

**Rafa:** Absolutely. Well first of all I had my bachelor's. I didn't have a master's, but I wasn't in a career field where a master's would have made me any more viable in the job market. When I was in the military, I was with the engineers and I did a lot of training to work in construction and my interest was construction. After my second deployment, I came back and one of the things when you go to vocational rehab, I think a lot of veterans have it in their mind that they can go in and say, "Well, this is what I want to do. I want to get my juris doctorate or I want to become a social worker or whatever when the focus should be the end result. You know, I would like to be involved with construction. I no longer am able to handle the physical requirements of my current job. I'd like to be in it or something like that rather than discussing you know the 5 m target which is I want to go back to school.

**(05:25)** In my case, going back to school didn't make sense. And I had done some contracting when I was in Afghanistan. So, I saw, you know, how much opportunity was out there. And having received some of my acquisition certifications, I came back and I told my counselor that I wanted to continue working with the federal government, but do it as a contractor.

**(05:44)** Okay. And then can you walk us through that process? So then what was the next step?

**Rafa:** After we agreed that I wasn't physically able to handle my duties anymore, I had been employed in the post office. Once we both agreed that I wouldn't be able to do that, we started looking at different options. Now something that I've been doing for a long time is rather than going to a counselor or a supervisor to give me an evaluation, I'll write my own accomplishments and objectives and it just makes it easier. So knowing that I wanted to go into federal contracting, I went and I had already approached the company which was Concrete Moisture Solutions and I gave them a presentation and basically I gave a PowerPoint selling them on the idea of doing business with the federal government.

**(06:33)** Once they agreed to represent me, I took that back to my counselor and I told her that I wanted to be a consultant in the federal market and that I wanted to bring this ad mixture for concrete moisture solutions to the forefront. So they put me in the OJT track which meant that while I was working for Concrete Moisture Solutions, I was pursuing my certifications. I was going to conferences. I was taking different courses online and attending different classes. I was receiving stipend from the vocational rehabilitation.

**(06:58)** Okay. So the OJT track does that fall under vocational rehab as well?

**Rafa:** It does.

Okay. So under vocation rehab, you took the OJT track and then Renona took self-employment track.

**Rafa:** Yes.

**(07:18)** Now when you were going to the conferences and the certifications, how does that work? Do you pay for that stuff and the government reimburses you or do they pay you for it? How does that how was that working?

**Rafa:** Well, the stipend comes every month. There's a form that I filled out. I think Concrete Moisture Solutions was giving me 1,200 a month. And I think that vocational rehab was around 19. And I had to fill out how many hours I spent giving presentations. I would show them how much travel time I spent, how much time I was spending sending out solicitations and filling out bids and attending conferences. And then I would give them an invoice for the travel arrangements that I done, including the hotel and the flights and things like that. And then they would reimburse me with that.

**(08:02)** Okay. Was that the same thing for like the courses as well and conferences?

**Rafa:** Yes. Once I enrolled in a course, I would send them the invoice and then I would be reimbursed for it within a month or so.

**(08:19)** Okay. Rona, now you took self-employment track.

**Renona:** Yes. The self-employment track is more specific to your specific business when it comes to comprehensive training, supplies, soft supplies meaning paper and pencil and things like that that you may need to run your business. But with regard to the self-employment track, the first step for all the tracks is of course you have to go to Voc Rehab. They do a comprehensive evaluation to see what your skill sets are. And just as Rafa said, you know, if you're unable, the key here is to help them reintegrate you into the workforce. So you're unable to do, you know, what you did with your job and you need to learn a new skill. And so with self-employment for me, you know, I've been an employee. I was a specialist. I was a branch chief at every level. However, you know, I did not have the skill and knowledge and experience to start a company and you know how that would look. And so, you know, once you sell your idea to your counselor, you know, and get them to believe in you, then they have a program that they put you into.

**(09:22)** They have several programs, but the one that they actually are highly recommend is the accelerator program. An accelerator program brings you in to see okay you have this idea about this business. So let's qualify and quantify that business and let's see is it just an idea is it a hobby or is it something that we can qualify and quantify and then is it something that can be sustainable and once you go through the accelerator program and they help you do your business plan and everything like that then you're supposed to do and this doesn't happen but it's supposed to be a feasibility study. So for me, my company was an HR consulting company. And so you look at that and you say, "Okay, what are all of the hard costs that you need to do this? Do you need to be incorporated? They'll reimburse you on that.

**(10:08)** Do you need a professional photo? Do you need a website? You need any hard or soft costs that you can imagine including a computer or whatever you need. You know, you have that on your feasibility study, any certification, any courses like your course, the GovCon course. Is this something that can specifically help you with regard to doing government contracts? And they'll they'll pay for that. They'll pay for any certifications that you need. If you need your project management certification, they'll pay for traditional type of business. They'll pay for anything that is in alignment with what your company your specific company is. And once you get like initially when you go in, you have to apply for it and then they determine what track you're in.

**(10:52)** So if you have a serious employment handicap or if you just have an employment handicap is one of the criteria they look at. For track one you can receive up to $100,000 in reimbursement for your business. For track two you can receive up to $25,000. Now, with that amount said, it it's not you can exceed that if you verify that I need this this fingerprint machine for my business, you know, in order for me to stand my business up because this is what my idea was about.

**(11:22)** Let's say I'm a staffing company or whatnot. So, I need this specific computer, this specific fingerprint machine, or I need this if you're a photographer, I need this type of camera, you know, I need this, or if you're a farmer, I need these type of tools. And there's some things that they don't reimburse and the regulation is clear on that.

**(11:39)** And so as you go through the process, there's the things that they'll reimburse you academic wise, preliminary stuff. And then when you get into the phase of standing your business up where you actually need those specific things like let's say GovCon training, you need that you need a mentor coach. They will even reimburse you on that.

**(11:58)** And so that's the self-employment track kind of in a nutshell is a little bit more, you know, more detail because when you're dealing with your counselors, you think of it like a patient doctor relationship where, you know, you're constantly in communication with them about, you know, you may need to take a pivot or a turn for this and you may need this that you didn't realize in your feasibility study that you need now, you know, in order to stand up and they'll say, "Okay, you got to sell that idea and why?" And then they can reimburse you. Either they can pay for it with the credit card or they can pay out of pocket and they'll reimburse you what you paid.

**(12:26)** A couple questions. Who devises a feasibility study? You do.

**Renona:** Well, the feasibility study can be done through the accelerator program or you can even let's say if you were a company that did a feasibility study for government contracts. Okay. And you know, and I went in and I said, "Okay, here's GovCon and Eric Coffie's company provides feasibility studies for this specific part of what my HR company needs because I would like to enter into the federal government market, you know, what that looks like." And then you'll look at my company idea in my business and you'll say, "Okay, so maybe you need a mentoring and coaching certification and this is how much it's going to cost." or well if you're doing a specific feasibility study and you're looking at the company and say well maybe you need GovCon that give you a step by step to show you everything you need to do with regard to registering in SAM and you know and then we'll hold your hand so when you go to post part of it then you can hire us again you know for a one year because they do the post part once you stand up where you can actually get a mentor and you can request these things a lot of folks don't know this part in fact I've learned as I went that I could have went well I need not just the accelerator but I may need a specific HR company that I can model or mentor protégé that can give me okay what do you exactly do you want your business to look like you know are you going to be a staffing are you going to be benefits are how does that relate to government contract so it's you got to be really clear what you know what you want to do when you're talking to your counselor and explaining that to them and hope that they get that picture and then that they believe in your idea and you know and they'll check mark. Okay. And if they don't, you have to convince them as to why. And most times you're able to do that if you if you really have those needs for your business.

**(14:11)** Now, you said there's different tracks and you mentioned track one, right?

**Renona:** The track the there's the first three tracks are like Rafa said was for on the job training and the other two they're all academic. There are tracks let me say this too just so veterans will know. I have my master's degree and it doesn't matter about the if you have a degree because the Voc Rehab will give you that challenge. You know, some offices will say, "Well, we're not degree program or we're not." But that specific degree may not be what you need that you can use to if you're unable based on your service connected disabilities to either get a job or start your business.

**(15:04)** And so, you know, in the reg, the more empowered and educated that veterans are with regulation and what they say, you know, the better off you are with regard to challenging those type of obstacles that will come your way.

**(15:28)** Now, while I was asking you, you said track one, track two, track three. You say most of them are all educational tracks and you were beyond the education part.

**Renona:** Well, for me, because I I you know, I had a business. I had an idea to start a business. Okay. And and so for me, I was I was unable to continue to work and that is one of the criteria. I couldn't have sustainable work. So self-employment and independent living are along those lines where you you can't work, you know, but you can start a business, you know, where you have the flexibility or independent living where you can start a business but maybe there's a hobby or something that you want to do to have a fulfilled life. And that's what independent living is also closely aligned with self-employment.

**(15:58)** Now Rafa, what made you choose OJT over self-employment?

**Rafa:** And by the way, before I ask you that question, I don't see OJT on the screen.

OJT, I believe, falls underneath one of these. I forgot which one. The other three, I'm not as familiar as I am with self-employment, but it falls underneath one of those, right?

**Rafa:** Okay. Yeah, it probably falls under that long-term employment through long-term services. But yes, it does. I see it here on the job training.

**(16:34)** Right. My reason for it was twofold. First of all, I was entering the market with a product that I really believe has application, long-term application. So, if I was able to get the ad mixtures into the federal market, I would have a recurring supply with the federal government from Concrete Moisture Solutions, and I would continue receiving revenue from that company.

**(16:57)** Gotcha. Okay.

**Rafa:** Also, with the self-employment track, it wasn't my personal experience, but I have known other people that say they're simply pointed towards the small business administration for guidance on how to do a business plan and how to go forward and they're put in contact with a PTAC. All of that I could do without any help of vocational rehabilitation. So for me to do the OJT, it gave me a two-prong approach to getting into federal contracting. One, I had the civilian company supporting my endeavors and then I also had vocational rehabilitation giving me that additional platform to move forward.

**(17:40)** So you know I I don't know how it was with Renona. Once I left the post office and I began going forward with getting my certifications and registering in SAM and getting my LLC registered and going to Washington DC for conferences and Orlando to meet with NASA and to South Carolina to meet with the Savannah nuclear plant and just doing that traveling it pulled me away from any source of revenue if I hadn't been going along this track that I had built up you you know, at at every point along the way, I was receiving the two sources of income. One from the company that wanted me to get them into the government and one from the government wanting me to get the certifications to be able to stand up on my own. Um, having said that, I also want to be very clear that when I set up Brave One Contract Agency, in order for me to get my certifications, my service disabled veteran certification, my economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, my HUBZone certification, all of that was contingent on my personal demographics. And that required me to be my own LLC. Even though I was working for Concrete Moisture, I was not directly an employee for them. Okay. Um, and it goes along the pattern of what you're talking about being a consultant.

**(18:48)** So, now, um, let me ask you this. I know we know that you approached them, but what made you believe that you could approach them with vocational rehabilitation? What made you believe that they would go for that?

**Rafa:** Well, I kind of operate off this rule of three, and I think we've talked about this. You're going to have to tell me no three times before I give up. And like Renona, probably 10 years ago after I got back from Afghanistan, I came back to the States. I went through my yellow ribbon and I did my medical evaluation and I was having problems with my hips. So I received a disability rating and I got the letter and I contacted the Winston Salem Vocational Rehabilitation. I told them I'm now qualified as a disabled veteran. I'd like to come and do my evaluation.

**(19:49)** I thought I could just go in and talk to them and convince them that the post office was no longer a viable career, you know, because I was in the National Guard. And I went in and I think I addressed it incorrectly, you know, and again, that was about 10 12 years ago, maybe 15 now. And I went in with the idea that I could get another degree or I could readjust myself to go into another career field.

**(20:14)** After I got back from Kuwait, my disability rating was increased and I realized you don't really go in and say, you know, I want to go to school and this is what I want and I need this Apple computer and I, you know, I want to have these ergonomic chairs and desks and everything. I'm not physically able to do this job anymore. And my interest is contracting. You know, having deployed three times and working in contracting two of the three times, it gave me an idea that it was an area that I was interested in, something that was exciting to me. You know, meeting a need and and being able to supply something. It kept me involved. But, you know, I knew after Kuwait that my time with the military was going to be limited. You know, I I'd been diagnosed with cancer. I physically I just wasn't going to be able to continue through. So I started examining my options.

**(20:54)** Renona, something that Rafa mentioned interesting enough was that did you experience that in the self-employment track where they tried to send you to the SBA for all your training and to the PTAC? Was that your experience?

**Renona:** That's absolutely right because the self-employment track is not a popular track. They try to I don't want to say they and I don't want to say what they tried but it's it's true. they shy you away from applying for self-employment track because it's a process and there's a lot to it. You know, first you're walking in there and you're saying because of my disability, you know, I have an employment barrier, I can't work for anyone, you know, and then you're saying that I need help, you know, and I I I still have I have this strong desire to start my business. Can you help me? You know, and then they're going to say, well, we can retrain you, blah, blah, blah. you know, and they're going to kind of discourage you in the self-employment track. That's what one of the things I say to people that I talked to about it is you got to do your homework. First time I went, I I was denied, you know, because I didn't.

**(22:09)** And then the second time I dug into regulation and I saw that this is the self-employment track is for veterans. And regarding the monies to start a business, that's what hurt a lot of a lot of people is the startup cost. Are you looking for grants and for this, right? Yeah.

**(22:28)** They sent me on a wild goose chase going into SBA. SBA has gotten better. Go to SBA and you can listen to all these videos and things like that. And yeah, there's things that you have to do, but it costs money to do your LLC. It costs money, you know, to do certain things. It's going to cost you money, you know, to do those things. And the VA is saying, "Hey, you have this service this disabled, this employment handicap, and we're going to help you, you know, retrain you and we're going to provide X amount of monies to help you stand your business up. You know, once we've verified that it is a qualifying and sustainable business, then yes, we're going to pay you these things.

**(23:07)** Now, you got to tell us what are the specific things that you need, you know, to help your business." And this is where the other tracks don't pay is they will pay for these things. They will pay not only for your but they pay for the computer and the desk and all that kind of stuff if especially if you have a reasonable accommodation. They'll pay for that. But that's outside of what you need to stay in your business. If you need a special computer that may, you know, cost you $5,000 or whatever the case may be. I'm just throwing an amount out there. Then and you can't afford to pay for that, you know, to start. That's going to stop you, preclude you from starting your business. and you and it's in your feasibility study that you need this then the VA will pay for that for you.

**(23:41)** Okay. And so to answer the question, do they discourage and is it a track that people don't necessarily pursue? That's true. You know, because everybody is not a business owner minded type thinking person initially. I just knew I was at the end of my rope when it came to working for someone. I couldn't do it. Right. Right. You know, so my next theme was I want to start my business. I want to give back and here's a track that VA has. What do I need to do to be eligible to qualify for this track?

**(24:01)** Where no um where did you find that information at? You know, in terms of how do you determine if you're eligible for that particular track?

**Renona:** In the M28R? Um I can provide all the resources. Okay. But we could do it we could share it afterwards. Yeah. I'll provide all the resources. I also follow Benjamin Krauss on veteran of veteran. He's one of the only veteran lawyers that talks about all the tracks. Doesn't talk about self-employment a lot, but he does talk about self-employment. And so he has a workbook on how to prepare yourself before you go talk to your counselor and I actually followed his steps and that's when I did that. That's when I got approved. So it's just getting into the regulation and read. Chapter 8 talks about the self-employment track and the M28R and this is not a very user friendly because they also kind of compare with war worms. So it's all kind of separated this way the you're scrolling down but if you go to Benjamin Krauss's website and he has that's his newsletter that he puts out and he gives you V Rehab tips. He has a website that actually has the M28 like all together so you don't have to try to navigate through, you know, and find everything that you need. So, he has everything in one spot.

**(25:31)** Okay. Okay.

**Renona:** I just I researched. So, to answer your question, I researched, I read, I did my homework, and when I went to talk to the counselor, I was prepared. So, I would tell, you know, veterans, just be prepared. Know what you're entitled to. figure out what is best for you, what you like to do, and then pursue that. Don't don't take no for an answer. Like Rafa said, no, I I go three time. I go more than three. I do eight. [laughter]

That's a little bit excessive, but that's okay.

**Renona:** I'm excessive, but you know, that's where I'm successful, you know. Sure. I get it. Persistent. Persistence is the number one key to success.

**(26:12)** No, no, I have it here. Chapter eight, the guidelines for development administration of a self-employment plan.

Got it. Okay. Now, you talked about, you know, once you get on the track, you had to put together the budget. Do you have is that something that we could maybe tweak so we could share with people later on? We could take yours and and revamp it, make it something that's non non secretive.

**Renona:** Yes, I share with a lot of my veteran friends that are pursuing it now.

**(26:36)** Now, what would be the first step for someone? Where should they start?

**Renona:** The first step is to contact Voc Rehabilitation and say you're interested in the services through Voc Rehab. You don't have to be specific to what service because most of the offices you have to go through a 4-hour I don't know assessment seminar they'll send you a test that you have to take prior to going to that appointment. So you got to make sure you do that. And then when you go in you need to have the application which I share. I don't have the form number off the top of my head. You need to have that application submitted. So, you should have an idea of what it is you want to do because they'll bring the group in. They'll do this assessment and then they'll break you off into individual counselors. And then at that point is vital. That's your first appointment and you need to be prepared because that's when you go in there and you're selling your idea on what track. If it's self-employment or one of the other tracks, you know what you want to do and why. And that's when you're talking to that counselor about that. Then they'll pull up and they'll look at your assessment and they'll say, uh, remember the first time I went, well, you know, you're qualified for these other type of things, you know, and I'm like, yeah, but I'm not interested in those other type of things. This is what I want to do, you know. So, it's based on your interest, you know. So, they'll discourage you and then you, you know, you just have to sell yourself to your counselor.

**(27:54)** Would that be the same thing, Rafa? What you experience in OJT track? What would be the some of the steps?

**Rafa:** Pretty much. It did go exactly like Renona said. I contacted vocational rehab, made the appointment, walked into a conference room with probably 20 other veterans, waited for my name to be called out. When I eventually got back with my counselor, like I said earlier, I already had a plan to go forward. I had an idea what I wanted to address and and how I wanted to sell it to her.

**(28:34)** Renona is right. This isn't something that you go into thinking, I'll just ask them if they can help me start my business. You know, they they want to know that it's got legs, that it has some kind of foundation under it. There's a lot of resources out there for veterans and sometimes it's almost like information overload. You know, there's just so much out there. and Renona and I both went to different training that we know it was a federally funded event, but to walk away with something that was valuable, that was kind of questionable. When you go and you talk to your vocational rehabilitation counselor, let them know that you're working towards that goal, whatever it is.

**(29:17)** In my case, it was to get into the construction field. In Renona's case, it was human resources. And you know, I'm sure there are some veterans out there that would like to start a brewery or they want to do an eBay store or graphic arts or something like that. So, go with that plan and help them realize the end point that you're going towards. You know, don't go in and say, "I just need you to help me." Because they have a really heavy workload. You know, I've seen where the goal is one counselor to 125 veterans. But I understand a lot of them have more than that. So when you go in, have that end goal in your mind when you're talking to them. I think the reason they prefer academics is because that's a tried and true avenue that a lot of veterans use, you know, but um and even with that, well, it's tried and true in terms of I guess you could effectively you can achieve receiving a degree, right? So that's the only tried and true portion of it. in terms of, you know, workforce or employment or needs or compensation for being paid. That doesn't that's no longer tried and true.

**(30:15)** Absolutely. And the thing with veterans is when you get out of the military, you know, the Montgomery GI Bill was a great educational program. I mean, you go to college and you receive E5 stipend. That's a very good allowance to have. So a lot of vets will leave the military and they'll begin their college and it will be like a job but the end is not a guarantee. Um there are other programs and if you look back at the one that I followed the OJT they also have apprenticeship which is brilliant you know because oh apprenticeship is wonderful. I think that's the way to go.

**(30:58)** Absolutely. You know especially if you're going to go into a trade like air conditioning or electrical or carpentry things. Absolutely. That's the way to go versus education.

**Rafa:** Absolutely. And you know one of the really sweet things that I found out, I've been putting in bids and one of my areas is elevator maintenance. You don't even need a college degree and you know, you're looking at 80K plus as an apprentice. So, and why not go that route, right? You know, I mean, we're short in the crafts in America.

**(31:17)** We are.

**Rafa:** So, and it's something that vocational rehab will help you follow. You know, I did the OJT because there's a lot of paperwork involved with being a contractor, you know, and we've had that conversation where, you know, how many businesses want to sit there and and write the solicitation and make sure we're compliant with DFARS and, you know, understand that our cyber security is on point and all that. So, you know, that happens to be my sweet spot. So, I enjoy doing it, but I also like construction, but it's hard, you know, it's hard to do a demo and then do a solicitation and then, you know, make sure your crew is out there painting when they need to be. The roofers are using the right kind of screws, you know, I mean, so to stay on top of it, but I do think the apprenticeship program with the vocational rehab is it might be underutilized. I think it's a great way to go forward.

**(32:08)** Wow. Apprenticeship program. Renona, you were saying that you learned some new things recently. You want to share?

**Renona:** Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was on the phone this morning for almost two hours with the VA regarding my own case. And um one of the things that I learned, which they do, they have an but they have a headquarters that you can call when you have issues with your counselor if you're not getting the answers that you need. And I reached out to them. But one of the things I learned is that when they talk about the $25,000 and the $100,000, they're they're talking about the $25,000 that's specific to whatever your business needs are that can even exceed that amount if your business needs warrant that in both cases. And I didn't know that.

**(33:07)** I I thought that those were things that were the preliminary part, meaning, you know, to to get your LLC, to get incorporated, which they pay for all of that to do for your web, your website, your professional photo, your insurance for up to one year, you know, and anything other preliminary stuff that you need just to be in the ready mode for your business, you know, they will pay, but they don't count that those monies as the monies that you need that are specific to your business, which is that $25,000 or $100,000 depending on what track you get approved for.

**(33:41)** Something I I read the self-employment track, too. That one that Renona was talking about, and there are certain things that the vocational rehab won't pay for. They won't pay for you to purchase vehicles or to purchase a building or lease office space, per se.

**Rafa:** Yeah, but and that's true. That's true, Rafa. But I'll tell you that there's less things that they won't pay for than what they will. So like the office pays, I mean that makes sense based business. You can do it at home. So they're not going to pay for your lease, but they also pay for post things. So if you need a mentor for a year or business consultant, they'll pay for that.

**(34:23)** That's great. That's that's that's golden.

**Renona:** Yeah. They want you they want you to be successful. They want you to stand your business up and to be successful. And they created this program, you know, to do just that. It's an excellent program. It really is. Doesn't have to be It could be any business like Rafa said, could be, you know, anything that that is providing opportunities for people or for yourself or for other veterans.

**(34:53)** Oh, now one thing that they won't do, they do help with franchise businesses, but they don't pay the franchise fees. Okay. And they they do they don't do nonprofit. So if you do a nonprofit, it has to be a nonprofit for profit. So those are some specific things that they don't reimburse.

**(35:15)** Okay. I'm a veteran. I'm coming out and um I'm listening to this and I'm excited. I'm saying, "Okay, you know, I want to get started and you know, I I I've got an idea for business and I want to get into the government contracting space with my business. You know, how long is this going to take me to get up and running? How long is it going to take me to get into these these programs? What is that? How what's the time frame like?

**Rafa:** Right. I think within two months. I'm I'm sure within two months I was getting checks from both CMS and vocational rehab at that time. Okay. And you know, again, there's a difference between my construction side and my federal side. like I I have different jobs going on, but it it took me several solicitations before I had any kind of response, you know? I mean, I did not have a first time home run. [laughter] And I don't know if I'm the exception or the rule on this, but no one has first time home runs. [laughter] So, while I was going through that, I was still being supported. You know, I still had vocational rehab on the left shoulder and I had CMS on the right, you know, saying, "Keep going. keep going forward with this.

**(36:17)** Okay. Renona, how long before you were able to be reimbursed for your expenses or the tracks or, you know, the education, things like that, the the travel, the the conferences?

**Renona:** Well, the the education part of it was pretty much immediately because I was eligible for Post 9/11 monies. So the BAH part of it was you know as soon as the semester started which was maybe 60 days. Okay. Then I was eligible to receive that. Now the track itself I applied for track one and that took over a year for them just approved me. However, I was still allowed to go into the accelerator to see if my business was you know go through the process so to speak, right? And when I was disapproved for the track one, you automatically approved for track two. But that took over a year before they approve approved.

**(37:09)** But that was just that was just for the spec I'm sorry. Go ahead.

**Renona:** Yeah, that was for the track. Right. Right. Right. But they were still you were still getting stipend for one piece of it. I was still getting paid and they still reimbursed me, you know, some of the expenses I incurred too.

**(37:29)** Okay. All right. Okay. What would you either one of you, you could take a stab at this. What would you like to say to someone out here who's considering going down this path?

**Rafa:** Be resilient. Don't give up. Don't stop at the first roadblock you hit because I know I said it earlier, there's so much out there that is being offered to the veterans. The vocational rehab, you can find a way through this. you know, do your homework, go in, have an idea where you're going with it. And, you know, even between Renona and myself, we took slightly different course of actions, but in truth, I think we received a lot of the same stipends and pay outs. You know, I I got paid to take training. I got paid to do my LLC and my certifications, but when I presented it to my counselor, I did it in tandem with a company that had already been established. And it's worth it, but it it's not a walk in the park. You have to you have to put in your time.

**(38:40)** Renona, well, one of the things I would tell a veteran is, you know, the first thing you need to do is take an assessment of where you are. And you know, if you are having a hard time out there in the workforce and you're unable to, you know, to function, you know, know that there are programs out there that will help you. And once you know that within yourself, you know, and you identify that with whatever path, if it's that you need to be trained into a new skill or you have an idea for a business or maybe you just can't function and you know and you need the independent living track, but you want to feel fulfilled. You want to learn how to crochet. you want to learn how to knit or whatever it is, you know, so that you feel fulfilled and that you're able to help your family. When you decide that and you assess that, then the next step is to prepare and know that you have resources out there that going to help you.

**(39:28)** Now, one thing I I want to be clear about is that the regulations are clear. They are clear at what you're entitled to. And there's some offices across are not the same type of offices. You may go in and talk to a counselor and you may get things like what Rafa was really blessing some of the things was able to get, but those things aren't necessarily covered in the regulation. So, the regulation and policy is on your side, prepare, do your homework, and when you're going back and forth with them, you just say, "Well, doesn't it say right here that I'm entitled to blah blah blah?" And you show them, and then they can't deny that. And if you're not getting resolution with that, then you take it to the next level. You take it to the next level. And I remember what I was going to say. There's a liaison office um that you can contact that you can, you know, let them know that I'm not getting the support that I need, you know, from and they'll they'll look at policy. That's all they do is they'll look at policy. They'll contact that office and they'll say, "Okay, tell us why you're not supporting this veteran for this idea or this that, and the other." So you do have a support system out there you know just do assess yourself see where you are you know where you are with your family you know um how you are functioning out there in society you know at the workplace if you're unable to do certain things know that there are resources out there to help you so that you can continue life doesn't stop because you can't continue to move forward so I really want to emphasize that because there's a lot of veterans you know out there with PTSD and certain things. They just feel lost and that there's programs out there for you, nonprofit organizations, you know, all type of things. And this is one excellent program that will help you. Voc Rehab will help you.

**(41:18)** Can I just say one more thing? Sure.

**Renona:** Yeah. And also with with Eric's program with GovCon, you know, he didn't ask me to say this, but I just want to endorse this is that GovCon is one of the few programs, and I did a lot of research. If you guys are interested in pursuing the federal government sector, you know, the gov contract process and Eric's presence on YouTube, I found him on YouTube is excellent. He does snippets so it's not a whole lot of information. You understand it, you follow his step by step and I'm telling you, you be 50% ahead of, you know, where you need to be when you get ready to enter into the federal government sector. And then your next phase is of course with vocational rehabilitation they can help you with the rest to include paying for any program or services that he offers. So he didn't pay me to say that. I wanted to endorse you on that

**(42:07)** and I would agree with you. I see that um even when I read people's contents, they tell you about the FAR and the rules and you know, but that doesn't help me to learn how to actually pursue a a contract action or an activity or I like or like Rafa go out and find myself someone company that I can represent and take their product to the market and be able to benefit from it. And I think you know Rafa you did that and um I know you're still in that process and then Renona I know you know working with you um we were able to help a company get right there. We were to match up a company and with an agency and so I know you're working on that particular project and we got some more stuff coming out.

**(42:51)** So listen I'm happy I'm happy for the progress that everyone's making. Thank both of you for coming on today and sharing your knowledge and your information. And I just thought it was valuable because again I am receiving a lot of inquiries from people that are veterans and it seems to me that they're not aware these programs exist because if they were they would have you know their inquiries would be different because I because even before the two of you someone else I know took advantage of the program but I never was able to like wrestle them down and get that information but I had heard it before. So, there's some other people that are in the community that have done this. I can't remember who they were, but I know that just because it's the two of you I interact with regularly or visa v through Maria, I knew those the two of you at least were two people that I knew that successfully did it, you know, got the reimbursement for the course and everything paid for.

**(43:42)** So I thought that was great. And again, like I said, I'm not the expert on this particular subject matter. So I said, let me bring in some people who've actually done it, gone through the process, and can share it with others. So I thank you for that. Thank you for your service.

**(43:57)** Sounds good. Sounds great. All right. Thank you so much.
