# Tier 2 Supplier Research Plan

**Goal:** Create comprehensive Tier 2 subcontractor directory with SBLO contacts
**Target:** 200-500 Tier 2 suppliers across multiple industries

## 🎯 TIER 2 DEFINITION

**Tier 2 Suppliers are:**
- Companies that subcontract TO Tier 1 prime contractors
- Typically $50M-$500M annual revenue
- Often have their own small business programs
- Required to have SBLOs for larger subcontracts ($700K+)
- Less competitive, more accessible than Tier 1
